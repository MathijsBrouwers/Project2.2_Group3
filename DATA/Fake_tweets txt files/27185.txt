BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Wikileaks Exposes Hillary’s Campaign “Remain Close” with Convicted Serial Child Molester BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Wikileaks Exposes Hillary’s Campaign “Remain Close” with Convicted Serial Child Molester Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 5, 2016 
We’ve learned a great deal from the Wikileaks Podesta emails. 
From pay to play scams run by the Hillary to vile, nasty name-calling by the campaign chiefs to macabre occult “spirit cooking” ceremonies and the ongoing attempts to hide Hillary’s emails from FBI investigators and the public. 
Now, we’re finding out a VERY DISTURBING fact. 
John Podesta, Hillary’s CAMPAIGN CHAIR has CLOSE family ties to CONVICTED SERIAL CHILD MOLESTER Denny Hastert . 
From Wikipedia… 
In the email below, Podesta’s brother mentions Denny, saying he’s remained “CLOSE” to him. 
Denny Hastert was a wrestling coach, and he molested the boys on his team and then paid “hush money” to cover it up. 
These are the people who the Hillary campaign, and their family members call friends and keep in “close touch with.” 
It’s disgusting. 
This is why the word is out that the FBI and NYPD are absolutely disgusted by the content of the new Clinton emails being investigated which may involve child sex trafficking.
