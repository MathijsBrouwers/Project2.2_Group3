The goal of the organizers of the [June 20 - 21] coup d’état in Georgia was to make Georgia an authoritarian, criminal, client state with American military bases which defies international law and to establish a new model of the government of former president Mikheil Saakashvili. The Georgian government has serious challenges since anti-Russian radicalism in Georgia is nurtured by Western grants and the US Democratic Party.
