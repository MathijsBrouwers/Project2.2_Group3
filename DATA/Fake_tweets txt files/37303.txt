NATO is behind the decision not to invite Russia to the commemorations of the beginning of the Second World War.

A classic campaign has taken place there. This was carried out according to curricula drawn up in advance by NATO. All this is an information campaign and it had an absolutely unsightly, very dangerous break in Warsaw.

The commemoration ceremony in Warsaw is a colossal fake that goes beyond the bounds of what is permitted [â€¦] The events in Warsaw were announced as events to mark the beginning of the Second World War, but have turned into a classic campaign to rewrite history and disinformation. The mass media generally had nothing to do with it.
