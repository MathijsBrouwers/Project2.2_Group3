This is great news, everyone. It may have taken awhile, but it looks like the FBI is finally ready to take Hillary down for good! Donald Trump is soooo happy!!! 
Just moments ago, the FBI received the warrants that they had been waiting for so that they can search Anthony Weiner’s laptop for the Clinton emails he had stored. 
To make it worse, the file that he had stored the emails in on his laptop was supposedly called “Life Insurance.” 
You see, the FBI had already searched the laptop once for emails relating to Anthony Weiner and his 15-year-old sexting partner, but technically they couldn’t look through the Clinton emails they discovered. 
Well, this warrant will let them do exactly that. We already know that these new emails are both classified and maybe even CRIMINAL. Now we can finally make her taste justice for good. 
So I just wanna take a moment to say “THANK YOU” to the FBI. Thank you for finally growing a pair and taking on Hillary Clinton the way she needed to be. 
Now we need to share this out and let the world know the good news! Goooo Donald Trump!
