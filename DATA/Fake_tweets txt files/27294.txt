Lest anyone get the impression that Hillary Clinton would not do too much damage should she be elected, let’s take a little stroll down memory lane, shall we? 
Earlier this year while on the campaign trail, Hillary was asked at a town hall meeting by one of her supporters, “The next president will probably appoint several members of the Supreme Court. Would you consider appointing Obama?” 
Clinton replied enthusiastically, “Wow! What a great idea! Nobody has ever suggested that to me! Wow! I love that! Wow! He may have a few other things to do, but I’ll tell ya, that’s a great idea!” 
God help us… 
This actually brings up a very important point, something many people have overlooked during this election cycle: If we do not elect Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton can stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices, and in doing so, irreversibly steer our country down the path of no return. The America our Founding Fathers envisioned and strived for will be nothing more than a distant memory. 
SHARE the report if you believe we CANNOT let that happen!
