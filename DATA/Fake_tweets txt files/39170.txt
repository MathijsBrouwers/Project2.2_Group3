Alyaksandr Lukashenka instructed Belarusian foreign minister Uladzimir Makey to start talks with the Patriarch of Constantinople over a possible split from the Russian Orthodox Church. This is a condition voiced by American diplomats for further progress in Belarus' relations with the West and IMF. Such a move would be political suicide for Alyaksandr Lukashenka. However, it is supported by a pro-Catholic clan in the Belarus' ruling elite and by pro-western Foreign Minister, Uladzimir Makey, who is ready to replace Lukashenka.
