The European Union is a reactionary, oligarchic entity with a goal to create a unipolar world. In this context the EU views post-Soviet republics exclusively through the prism of unipolarity with the aim to keep the post-Soviet space in the state of disintegration. All EU programs, including the Eastern Partnership are designed around this idea. The sooner post-Soviet countries realize the harm of the European path, the sooner disintegration will end, and the countries will become truly independent.
