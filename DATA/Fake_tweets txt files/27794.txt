Pointless winner won’t let £500 prize change his life 27-10-16 THE joint winner of a £1000 jackpot on BBC series Pointless has said that he won’t let his new wealth change him. Norman Steele, who won £500 after splitting his prize with workmate Tom Booker, will even keep his current job as a postman. He said: “I could have earned a million pounds on some fancy ITV game show, but doing it on the BBC means so much more. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m going to spend, spend, spend, mainly on a return train journey to Manchester. “It’ll be cab there and cab home, which will set me back another £75, and, of course, a slap up, three-course meal for two at Pizza Express with several glasses of house white. “On the way home, I’ll visit our local and buy a pint for all the regulars. No crisps, mind, I don’t want them to get ideas. “Then I’ll go home, have a bath and think about how I’m going to spend my remaining £3.73.”
