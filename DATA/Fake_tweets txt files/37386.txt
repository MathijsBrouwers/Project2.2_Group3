In East European countries, led by NATO, there will be less public information and even fewer accountable media. What Vyshinsky and Assange are going through is a warning to everyone else. No transparency required, no place for objectivity. Just propaganda. Like the 1930s in Germany, like the 50s in the Soviet Union.

Journalists who report objectively are declared as ineligible in order to open up space for propaganda and placement of various half-truths. Great resources are allocated with the aim of creating the half-truth and in order to create confusion where it will become difficult to discern what is true. If that fails, influential individuals, identified as threatening, are risking charges of treason, espionage, theft of state secrets, endangering national security, "psychological torture" etc.
