November 1, 2016 EU member states approve Canada trade deal 
EU member states have officially endorsed the landmark Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada, the European Council says. 
“I am delighted to confirm that the EU is ready to sign the comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Canada,” said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Slovakia currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency. 
“It represents a milestone in the EU’s trade policy and our commitment to it,” Fico said in a statement, calling it a “modern and progressive deal, opening the door to new opportunities, while protecting important interests. Moreover, it has the potential to set the way forward for future trade deals.” 
Earlier on Friday, Belgium’s regional parliament of Wallonia gave the go-ahead for the country to approve the deal after its opposition to the accord scuppered this week’s planned signing ceremony.
