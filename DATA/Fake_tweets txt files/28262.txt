Keep your thanks, what veterans really need are good jobs   Jobs By Chris Tomlinson 
Skip the “thank you for your service.” Let’s talk about what veterans really need. 
Veterans Day is Friday, and strangers who learn that I served seven years on active duty in the U.S. Army will inevitably thank me for my service. While some people believe that veterans deserve lifelong gratitude for their role protecting our country, more than a few of us find it annoying; an empty platitude that civilians use to absolve themselves from asking what exactly we sacrificed, or what we truly need now. 
What post-9/11 veterans need are good jobs, with good benefits. They need employers who don’t thoughtlessly cut-and-paste job prerequisites that favor someone who spent four years partying at a state university over a vet who was waking up at 6 a.m. and wearing a uniform during 60-hour workweeks, except for when they were in combat.
