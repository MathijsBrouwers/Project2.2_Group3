Russia has its own version of what happened [with the MH17 flight downing on July 17, 2014]. But Western investigators simply assigned the perpetrators. If there was evidence, they would turn it into a bigger show. But they have nothing, so they continue to raise this topic by official statements. This is easier than admitting that the investigation was not objective.
