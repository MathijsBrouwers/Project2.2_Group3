If “Peaceful Uprising [is] a climate justice group that describes its task as ‘working to build an uncompromising movement to defend a livable future,’” why does it not recognize that there may BE no such thing?! After all, Dr. David Wasdell ( http://www.apollo-gaia.org/Har... , p. 15) wrote last year: “An increase of 1.5°C was implicit by around 1965. 2°C was implicit by about1978. So 2°C was already in the pipeline towards the end of the 1970s. Today we are under the illusion that reducing our emissions will still keep us under 2°C!”
If Dr. Wasdell is right about us living now with an “illusion,” the efforts of the Peaceful Uprising people are POINTLESS, and worse! Why doesn’t Dahr Jamail realize this? Why does he insist on keep feeding us a PARTIAL dose of the truth, not the WHOLE truth?!
