On November 8, 2016, an almost evenly divided America made a consequential choice. 
And in the end, they chose to elect the least most qualified candidate in U.S. history to become the 45th President of the United States of America. 
However, one Twitter user said something so profound, that it should send a chill up the spine of any decent and rational American. The tweet said: 
“Our first black president will have to have over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.” Our first black president will have to hand over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.

Yes, we should all allow that sink in for a few moments. 
After the election, neo-Nazis, Alt-Righters, White Supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan are all celebrating Trump’s election. 
Meanwhile, few, if any, minorities are doing the same, because they understand what his presidency will mean for their lives and the lives of their children. 
And while we can keep telling ourselves that “this is not who we are,” it’s important to recognize that it was that same denial that brought us to this point in our history. 
It’s time we took a hard look in the mirror and at the country we’ve created.
