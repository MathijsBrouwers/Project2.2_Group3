VIDEO : CNN BUFFOON WOLF BLITZER BEGS TRUMP TEAM TO STOP ATTACKS ON MEDIA VIDEO : CNN BUFFOON WOLF BLITZER BEGS TRUMP TEAM TO STOP ATTACKS ON MEDIA Videos By Amy Moreno October 27, 2016 
We will NEVER stop attacking this disgraceful North Korea-style government-run propaganda media whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections. 
The American mainstream media is the enemy of the people. 
If they want Trump of any of us to STOP attacking them, they need to STOP trying to ALTER the outcome of a presidential election by behaving like a SUPERPAC for Hillary Clinton. 
Until then, no – we won’t stop. 
Actually, we’ll rev it up a NOTCH. 
Watch the video: 
— The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) October 25, 2016 Tune out the North Korea media. 
And if you see them online, engage them – challenge them on their biased and unfair reporting. 
HOLD THESE BASTARDS ACCOUNTABLE. 
Do not shy away or hold back.
