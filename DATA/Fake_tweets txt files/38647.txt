The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem Désir, paid a three-day visit to Belarus. The visit's aim was to demonstrate how bad the things are with Belarus' media sphere.  Désir called on Belarusian authorities to reconsider existing measures that tighten state control of the internet. He urged to refrain from mandatory authentication of users posting online and praised the users’ right for anonymity. In other words, the OSCE Representative wants to make a stinking garbage out of the Belarusian segment of internet, and to turn it into a place full of extremists, terrorists and anarchists.
