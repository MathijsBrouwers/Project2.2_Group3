The Dutch-led JIT's investigation alleges that the Boeing was shot down by a Buk anti-aircraft system belonging to Kursk's 53rd Russian anti-aircraft brigade. The Russian authorities not only provided radar data to the Netherlands, but also documentation that the Buk missile that hit the Boeing belonged to Ukraine, but the information was ignored by the investigators.
