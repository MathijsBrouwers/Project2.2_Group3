Leftist Western circles, which were well-connected with Socialist International and contributed to NATO's establishment, elaborated the anti-Russian "Anaconda" concept. The conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan at the turn of the 1980s, USSR's Perestroika, which provoked separatism in the USSR and the Tiananmen crisis during the late stage of Perestroika, were not coincidences.

A similar West-instigated "Anaconda" plan is currently targeting China. It includes the whole perimeter of border conflicts: the Korean peninsula, Taiwan, the South China sea, the Indian-Chinese border in Arunachal Pradesh, disputes around Nepal and Bhutan, Kashmir and Indian-Pakistan conflict, civil war in Afghanistan, crisis around the Iranian nuclear programme and political struggles in a number of South-East Asian countries. The "Anaconda" is crawling to the Chinese territory itself when we talk about long-time attempts in Xinjiang and Tibet.
