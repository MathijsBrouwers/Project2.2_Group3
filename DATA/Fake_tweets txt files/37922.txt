The charges against Russia made by the Joint Investigation Team on the results of the investigation into the crash of the Malaysian Airlines airliner flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur are absurd. This is part of the information war launched against Russia in 2014. The tactics of this information war are another information dump, without proven facts.
