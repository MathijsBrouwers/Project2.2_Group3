For those who were hoping or dreading the continued presence of Crazy Joe Biden in a presidential administration after the Barack Obamas belatedly leave the White House, the loose-lipped 73-year-old has confirmed that the nation won’t have Joe Biden to kick around any more. 
Biden, who was rumored to be on Hillary Clinton’s short list for secretary of state and prior to that was being groomed as a late contender for the Democratic Party nomination in the event Clinton failed to carry California in the primary, told a Minnesota radio station Friday he has “no intention” of serving in Hillary Clinton’s administration as secretary of state or in any other role. 
“I don’t want to remain in the administration.… I have no intention of staying involved,” Biden told Minnesota radio station KBJR . 
He added, though, that he wanted to “help [Clinton] if I can in any way I can.” 
It’s not clear whether Biden’s lack of interest is absolute, or if he could be talked into serving as secretary of state despite his doubts.
