'Hungover' now recognised as a school of philosophy 12-11-16 
THE wisdom and insight that comes with a hangover is to be taught as part of philosophy courses. 
‘Hangoverism’ will be approached as an over-arching discipline, taking in elements from existentialism’s view that life is meaningless, all the way back to Socrates’ allegory of not being able to face leaving a cave and going outside. 
Philosophy professor Nikki Hollis said: “Many students will be able to relate to the teachings of Jeffrey Barnard and his theory that reality is just a construct that needs ignoring on a Saturday morning. 
“Now leave me the fuck alone. I went mental on Chardonnay last night. My head feels like it’s in a tumble dryer.” 
Meanwhile, academic journals have begun printing hangoverism essays, including The Morality of Bacon Sandwiches and Vomiting and Nothingness .
