The Belarusian opposition does its best to sabotage the 2nd European Games, and is already organizing provocations. Its representatives are implicated in the illegal sale of tickets and have even turned to the Russian activist group Pussy Riot who came to support them. The Belarusian opposition will bring a bunch of people, armed to the teeth, in order to humiliate Belarus in the eyes of foreigners.

Another strategy to spoil the 2nd European Games is to deflect public attention towards the EuroGames 2019 for gays and lesbians in Madrid. This event is one of the most important for the Belarusian opposition, just as May 17th when the UK embassy flies LGBT flags. The Belarusian opposition began selling tickets for the EuroGames and promises to issue citizens with visas for it free of charge, with the aim of taking Belarusians away from the country's main event.
