Lithuania plans to commemorate Polish revolutionary Wincenty Konstanty Kalinowski who it is claimed, without good reason, to be Belarusian. In their own interests, the West and Russophobia advocates have seemingly selected the little-known terrorist Kalinowski, as a Belarusian national hero, to promote terrorism. This encourages Belarusians willing to commit crime to obey orders from Western curators.
