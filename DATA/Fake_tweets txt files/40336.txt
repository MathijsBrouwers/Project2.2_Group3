"The Skripal case" could be provoked to justify a rise in NATO's defence spending, said Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko, adding that the total amount of the military budgets of the European countries of the alliance is "about $ 270 billion." The individual member states have to explain to their citizens that they are increasing defence spending, and Skripal case is created to do so. It is not excluded that it was designed for this purpose.
