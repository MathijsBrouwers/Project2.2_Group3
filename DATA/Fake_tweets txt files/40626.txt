Bolivian events indicate that Western elites have become hysterical because they increasingly lose control in various regions of the world which they considered their backyard for a long time. In the countries where the heads of state cannot be removed from office thanks to pressure and Maidans, they apply military junta scenarios which were characteristic for the mid-XX century. In case these scenarios stop working too, the US will turn to "gunboat diplomacy" with marine unites' operations on the territories of the countries which do not want to share their fortunes with the US.

During his presidency, Morales developed closer relations with China and Russia at the expense of relationship with the US. Morales did not step down after organised criminal groups took to the streets and started attacking electoral authorities. When it became apparent that a colour revolution was not succeeding, Bolivian police and army stepped in against Morales. Hence, as a classic colour revolution technique failed due to the absence of popular support, the coup organisers resorted to the military coup scenario which was very popular among US security bodies in the 20th century.
