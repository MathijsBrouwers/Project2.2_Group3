Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Published on Oct 26, 2016 As I embrace my deep emotion, And strive for conflict resolution, I live a life of full expression, Not shutdown by fear or suppression. 
Feeling it comin’? New Moon in Scorpio this weekend sets the tone for the month ahead, themes, needs, issues, etc. And that means “shadow work,” looking at all the deep dark needs, feelings, fears, and impulses that, when still unconscious, take us where we really don’t want to go and cause effects we regret in the future. So onward and upward is feeling, talking about, expressing, and just flat out being aware of ourselves. 
Whether you agree or disagree with the observations made in this video I hope they are food for thought and a springboard for further discussion within your circles of relationship. In this way, we can all become more aware of the socio-cultural-religious-educational conditioning going on so as to identify more clearly for ourselves and our children just what kind of life we want to propagate on this planet! Injoy!
