Kyiv never had any interest in reaching a peaceful settlement on the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The plans for the so called Anti-Terrorist Operation in Donbas were set up on 29 April 2014, before the conflict even started. This proves that already in April 2014, Kyiv was aiming for a military solution of the conflict. This was disclosed at a press conference by Vasiliy Prozorov, a defecting ex-officer of Ukraine's State Security Services.
