Brutal is right. Trending WHAT bias? James O'Keefe wonders why these 'journalists' are ignoring Project Veritas videos 
Look out Arizona, Obamacare is really going to kick you in the backside next year – 116%!?!?! 
How can this be in any way, shape or form acceptable to ANY person in this country, regardless of political affiliation? We should all be absolutely disgusted with these numbers and yet the law stands. @CounterMoonbat But it's Okay because someone else will pay?

Interesting how Democrats really think this is how it works. That some magical money fairy out there will flutter down from the heavens and dispense money from their money wand and make all of this go away. 
They refuse to accept the middle class, the very people they pretend to care about, are the ones getting kicked in the teeth by this law.
