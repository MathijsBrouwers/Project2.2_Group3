The United States has deliberately banned travel to Crimea in order to avert the recognition of the peninsula's reunification with Russia. The move is the latest show of double standards present in US diplomacy, particularly in light of Washington's recent recognition of the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory.

Crimea rejoined Russia following a March 2014 referendum, conducted in accordance with international law and democratic standards. The US and other countries have refused to recognise the legitimacy of the vote.
