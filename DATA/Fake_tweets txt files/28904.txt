A Russian fighter jet nearly collided with a US plane over Syria on October 17, according to DoD officials.
The Russian jet was escorting a much larger spy plane, said USAF Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigan, and it came within half a mile of a US warplane.The American pilot reportedly felt the turbulence generated by the Russian plane’s jet engines. Both planes were flying without lights during the night.
“I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together,” Harrigan said.
A hotline has been created between Russian and US forces to discuss approximate locations and flight paths of planes in order to avoid collisions in the future.
Russian forces have reported that they have not bombed Aleppo since October 18, but they continue to send constant air patrol to circle the region. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple
