Ukraine has set up a secret torture prison in Mariupol, called "The Library". The inmates are referred to as "books". At this facility, hundreds of people have been tortured, and two have been killed. This was revealed at a press conference in Moscow, when a former officer of the Ukrainian state security services, the SBU, presented photos and other evidence for the prison in Mariupol. At the photos one can see men in various ages with clear traces of violence. Russian politicians demand the UN to set up a tribunal to address Kyiv's violations.
