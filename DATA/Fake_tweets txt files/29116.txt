Protesters blocked the upper level of the George Washington Bridge into New York City during the busy Wednesday morning rush hour, causing extensive delays in both directions of the span. 
The upper level eastbound lane was closed for 15 minutes as police arrested 10 protesters around 8:15 a.m., officials said. Delays continued to build on the George Washington Bridge as a result. 
Motorists headed to New York who earlier faced a 60 minute delay are now looking at a 90-minute wait as of 9 a.m., according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
A reporter on the bridge tweeted the protesters are demanding “equal rights for immigrants” and “political power for marginalized communities.” 
As of 8:55 a.m., the deomonstration has ended, according to Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo.
