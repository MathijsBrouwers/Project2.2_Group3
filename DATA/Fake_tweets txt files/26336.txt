That's the problem. Donald Trump as already stated that he opposes a single-payer option (like Medicare for All), and he has provided no details whatsoever as to how he would otherwise "replace Obamacare." In either case, Trump has clearly demonstrated throughout the past half century that he cannot be trusted to keep his promises. Hillary, on the other hand, will need to appease her singer-payer advocating "Bernie" supporters if she hopes to get re-nominated for President (rather than Elizabeth Warren). There are many very good reasons why Hillary may end up finally implementing a Medicare for All healthcare program in the United States.
