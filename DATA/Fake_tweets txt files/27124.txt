Video out of Florida shows a panicked Clinton aide rush to her side in order to help her climb one step. 
When the aide sees Her Hagliness is going to reach a small riser before him, heâ€™s seen making a mad dash towards her. Hillary then turns, grabs his hand for balance and while clutching him for dear life manages to tackle the one step before her . 
You have to wonder what made him so panicked. Did she collapse once again in secret?
