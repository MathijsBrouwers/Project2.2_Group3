Russia, unlike Washington and its allies, has not interfered and is not going to interfere in the internal affairs of either the EU or other countries of the world.

The accusations of the US and the EU against Russia are absurd and unsubstantiated. Despite suspicions about the "Russian interference" in the US presidential election, the Americans could not find concrete evidence. The sanctions against Moscow imposed because of these accusations still remain in force.

The main purpose of these accusations is to “demonise” Russia in the eyes of Europeans.
