The European Parliament has no powers in the EU.

The European Parliament is not allowed to adopt or decide anything, but only has an advisory function. Policy in the European Union is not decided by the EU Parliament, but by the Commissioners in the EU Commission, who are appointed or dismissed by the EU President.

In fact, not much would change if we had no EU Parliament. It is a representative body. It used to be possible to do without a directly elected parliament and the EU could continue to exist without it.
