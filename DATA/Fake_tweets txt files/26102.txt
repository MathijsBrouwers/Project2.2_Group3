11.23.2016 @8:08 PM EST Soros funds anti-Trump army of liberals to fight hate crime 
WASHINGTON D.C. ( INTELLIHUB ) — Billionaire George Soros just pledged $10 million in funding to liberal groups in opposition of what Soros says are ‘deeply troubling hate crimes perpetuated by the President-elect Donald Trump.’ 
Soros’ Open Society Foundations plans to launch next week with half of the funding pledged for starters after the Southern Poverty Law Center was flooded with reports of hate and violence. 
In New York Gov, Andrew Cuomo said that the New York Police Department will be rolling out a new domestic police unit that will be responsible for enforcing hate crimes.
