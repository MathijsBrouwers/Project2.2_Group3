I've read every TWD comic. Kirkman is definitely a leftist cuck. The books are replete with interracial and homosexual couples.
But... In the books, Rick is still in a relationship with Andrea, who is the hottest blonde in the book.
The show killed her off in the 3rd season of the show, I'm sure with the intention of eventually hooking Rick up with that monkey.
I haven't watched an episode since he committed racial treason, even if it was fake.
