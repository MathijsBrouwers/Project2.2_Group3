From MSN : Alicia Keys doesn’t want her kids “Fallin'” for the lessons in classic Disney animated films — especially Snow White. 
In the latest issue of The Edit magazine , the 35-year-old discussed why she doesn’t like her two sons watching certain movies. “They say that every child learns from their mother — and it’s ingrained from babyhood,” Keys said. “I get real funky about the classics; I don’t like [my sons] watching [the original Snow White]. It’s totally sexist, misogynistic — she’s cleaning for seven dwarfs.” 
The 1937 Disney animated film pits the titular White against an evil witch, with a colorful cast of dwarves for her to take care of. The “Girl on Fire” singer went on to clarify that it’s not how White spends her time that bothers her. “There’s nothing wrong with a woman who chooses to stay at home with her family, it’s a hard-ass job, but it’s the way it’s spoken about,” she said. 
As an artist, Keys has been known to create anthems for change and focusing on individuality. “For the first time, I’m recognizing how art, activism, socially what we’re going through, all go together,” she said. “For the longest time I thought it was all separate.” 
Blah, blah, blah. Read the rest of the story here .
