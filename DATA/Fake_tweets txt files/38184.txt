Experts attribute the scandal to the North Stream-2 gas pipeline, which makes people in the US, Poland and the Baltic states unhappy. Washington has long sought to thwart the project in any possible way, including through direct pressure on Germany. Opponents of the pipeline may be repeating the "Skripal" case scenario to raise tensions between Moscow and Berlin. Hopefully, common sense and a pragmatic approach will prevail.
