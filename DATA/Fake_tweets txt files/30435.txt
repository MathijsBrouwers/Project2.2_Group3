BODY BLOW: For a puppet of a loser no one’s ever heard of, Evan McMullin hits back pretty hard Posted at 11:45   
Though some suggest the Mormon Mafia was responsible for his rise to power, Evan McMullin nevertheless has made an amazing showing so far in Utah, managing to best both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in one poll. 
That momentum put him on Trump’s radar at last. On Saturday, the GOP nominee wrote off McMullin as “a puppet of a loser” whom no one’s heard of. You saw this coming. Trump and Pence finally go after @Evan_McMullin . Trump calls him @BillKristol 's puppet. pic.twitter.com/GKExwfDXZK

— McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) October 30, 2016 The funniest thing about Trump's attack here is his claim that @Evan_McMullin is "going from coffee shop to coffee shop" to win Utah.

Word is the Mormon Mafia drove the caffeinated beverage racket almost clean out of the state, but residents are anything but low energy   election. Trending   
For a puppet, it turns out McMullin can punch back pretty hard. . @realDonaldTrump , Yes you’ve never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad. https://t.co/hNDTWn3HPN
