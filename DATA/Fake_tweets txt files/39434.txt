The UN General Assembly resolution regarding the militarisation of the Crimean peninsula is proof of an ongoing campaign against Russia, aimed at finding anti-Russian traces.

The resolution was adopted under the pressure from the West, it is a continuation of the anti-Russian policy and it is not about the Crimea. If the Crimea did not exist, the West would have come up with something else, directed against Russia.

By adopting the resolution, a group of the UN member states, mostly from NATO and the EU, encourages Ukrainians to commit new crimes and provocations in the name of Western political ambitions.
