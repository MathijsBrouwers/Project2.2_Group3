There’s a strong resemblance between sanctions Russia faces since 2014 in trade and commerce – and “sanctions” applied against Russia before and during the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.




In both cases sanctions were introduced by international bodies under strong US influence (we’re talking the EU here, of course).

...

Either those who come up with ideas of ‘punishing Russia’ – be it in sport or in commerce &amp; trade – belong to a rare and extreme sect that believes that the ‘guilty-as-charged’ principle should always be applied.

Or they are but a bunch of cynical bastards who somehow think that they shall always come out on top – refusing to recognize that the game has changed.

Now it’s become a game of the 'zero-sum' variety, where the losses of the other side are always going to be balanced eventually by the losses of perpetrators. Sanctions and 'punishments' simply don’t work anymore.
