It may be true that is the way things currently are with Obama care, and it may be he is saying the exact same thing you are.
I think he's saying he wants to fix a problem, not promising summary execution. Not "the literal KILLING of tens of thousands of American men, women, children, babies, and fetuses PER YEAR..."
If that's what he was saying would anybody vote for him? Look again, he may be agreeing with you. BTW- I am not a Trump supporter, I just like things stated clearly.
