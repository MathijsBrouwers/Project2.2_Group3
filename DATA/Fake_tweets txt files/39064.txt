The Estonian Foreign Minister Sven Mikser says that at present, Russia's attention is focused more on Ukraine's presidential elections than on interference in the elections and democratic processes of EU and NATO countries. In other words, he admitted that Russia is not interested in “intervening” in elections in Estonia, which will be held almost a month earlier than Ukraine's.
