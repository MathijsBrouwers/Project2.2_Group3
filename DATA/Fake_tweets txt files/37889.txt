The Joint Investigation Team has recently accused three Russian nationals of responsibility for the MH17 disaster, after years of ignoring hard facts and figures provided by Russian officials.

All the evidence supplied by Moscow, including military paperwork, radar readings, and field experiments, point to Russia's non-involvement in the tragedy.

At the 19 June JIT press briefing, the Dutch prosecutor was forced to admit that Russia had, in fact, provided the investigators with information relating to the incident, proving that the BUK missile belonged to the Ukrainian Army and providing relevant radar data. However, the information was not taken into account.
