Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes the same speeches as Poroshenko did. It means that the monstrous experiment on turning Ukraine's residents into the enemies of Russians will continue. Ukrainian army and repressive entities eliminate Russian cultural code holders. Some of them are killed with missiles and bullets. Others are eliminated morally, through imprisonment, church captures and reformatting children into Ukrainians through education and activities of patriotic organisations.
