Here’s a preview of Hillary’s America should she be elected president: in Germany, a Syrian refugee has four wives and 22 children that German citizens reportedly support via more £320,000 per year worth of benefits. 
The U.K. Express reported : 
The migrant, known only as Ghazia A, fled Syria last year along with his family. 
He has since resettled in Germany with his four wives and 22 of his children. One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. 
The family could be receiving more than £320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers’ Association website. 
There is no official confirmation on this figure. 
Under Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives – as long as he can support them financially. 
Don’t forget everyone, all cultures are equal so you have to respect a culture that says it’s okay to have four wives and 22 children that the rest of society supports. 
Since Germany doesn’t legally recognize polygamy — being a civilized country and all (not for long) — they couldn’t all live together and get benefits. But don’t worry, Ghazia found a way to be compliant with the law and get German taxpayers on the hook for his lifestyle. Isn’t multiculturalism just swell? 
How it works is that Ghazia chose a “main wife,” and now the other three and their children get government benefits to support them. 
Ghazia, his main wife, and their five children live in Montabaur, which is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. His other wives and children are spread around up to 31 miles away. 
Back in Syria, Ghazia worked in a garage and car hire service, but ever since he settled in Germany and received government benefits for his family, he just can’t seem to find the time to work anymore. 
He claimed that he wants to work, but because of his religion he has to make sure he spends enough time with each family. Ghazia told German newspaper Bild: “In our religion it is my duty to visit every family and to be with them.” 
Sergei Jaufmann, a neighbor of Ghazia, said according to the Express: “The children play football in the street. The mother I often see, when [she] comes from shopping.” 
According to the Express, a social media user noted that “the Syrian with 4 women and 23 children is now being sold to us as a new normality.” 
Yes it is. This is a prime example of how globalists are actively working to tear down the western world. Refugees and immigrants aren’t expected to assimilate to the culture; the culture is expected to adapt to them. And not only that, you get to pay for it. 
Sorry, all cultures aren’t equal and people from around the world that are clamoring to get into the west — aside from the terrorists that we’re supposed to pretend aren’t abusing immigrant/refugee streams — know that full well, which is why they want to come here and take advantage of what western culture built.
