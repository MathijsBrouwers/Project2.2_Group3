After the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Belarus was next on the list for Western "democratisation". However, the West did not dare to apply this scenario against Belarus because of the latter's military alliance with Russia, a nuclear state. Instead the West decided to undermine Belarusian statehood by financing the opposition. During 25 years of Lukashenko ruling the West undertook at least seven attempts to organize revolution in Belarus. Mass protests after the 2006 presidential election in Belarus were managed from Vilnius and sponsored by the American CIA through Lithuanian State Security Department.
