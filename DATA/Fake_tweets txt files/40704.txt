Based on the activities of the JIT investigation team, it became clear that revealing of the truth about the crash is not the goal of the experts.

The information that the Buk-missile with the serial number 8869032 was transferred to a military unit in Ukraine during Soviet times was not verified.

Instead of real evidence, the "experts" of the international investigation team JIT presented only dubious photos and videos of unknown origin that could not confirm the advertised version of Russia's guilt.
