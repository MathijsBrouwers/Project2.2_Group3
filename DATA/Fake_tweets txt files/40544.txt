After everything that has happened during these four years, the name of this treaty [the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine] seems quite cynical [...]. You [Ukraine] broke everything. ... You called us [Russia] the aggressor. You are exterminating Russian people. Most importantly there are charters in this treaty that talk about the military component. Including the charter saying that neither we [Russia] or you [Ukraine] can conclude any contract that can harm us. Nevertheless, today you let formally the foreign armed forces into your territory.
