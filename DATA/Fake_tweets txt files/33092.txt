Imagine my shock upon learning that Hitlery lied through her teeth at her five-second “news conference” last night regarding the reopening of her Clinton Crime Family email case by the FBI. She declared that the FBI had notified only Republican members of Congress about this, implying a dark conspiracy between the Obama administration’s FBI and the Republican Party. Vast Right-Win Conspiracy, Act II 
But, lo and behold, one of the talking head shows revealed that “ranking Democrats” in Congress were notified at the same time as the Republicans. 
This was vintage Bill Clinton whose modus operandi was always: ” I wonder if I can get the suckers to believe this one?” 6:46 am on October 29, 2016
