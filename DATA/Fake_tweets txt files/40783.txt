Secret documents show that just three days after the MH17 tragedy, the Ukrainian secret service conducted a special operation to wipe out all the evidence about the tragedy. They worked with the witnesses, demolished documents and relocated the military troops to other positions. President Poroshenko and his generals are guilty for shooting down the flight MH17, and the Ukraine Air Force participated in it.
