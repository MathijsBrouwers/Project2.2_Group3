The current regime in Kyiv has brought conflict to Ukraine: war, the loss of Crimea, shootings at Maidan, economic collapse, impoverishment of the people, and much more.

The basis of the conflict is a coup d'état. If there hadn’t been a coup d'etat, early elections would have taken place, and Crimea and Donbas would have remained in Ukraine.
