It is possible, says woman who survived four-year relationship with twat 10-11-16 A WOMAN who survived four years with a knobhead has given hope to humanity. 27-year-old Mary Fisher went out with a dick called Paul for the length of a presidential term. Fisher said: “To be honest, the four years went by just like that. It’s scary, really. Where does the time go? “I was continually thinking about dumping him but you know how it is, he’d do something dickish like selling my bike at Cash Converters to go out on the piss, then be massively apologetic so that I’d take pity on him. “Looking back I have no idea what I was playing at, which I imagine might become a familiar sensation to quite a few Americans. Anyway it’s over now.” She added: “I definitely wouldn’t go out with him for another four years though. I need to make that very clear. No way.”
