The outcome of Ukrainian presidential election will be decided in Washington. And it is very likely that Washington will come to the conclusion that Tymoshenko is a better option than Poroshenko. And then Poroshenko will announce that he has fulfiled his duty and not run in the election again and Tymoshenko will take his place.
