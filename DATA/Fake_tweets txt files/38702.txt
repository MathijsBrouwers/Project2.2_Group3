The West has taken into account Belarus' capacity to resist attempts to the  perform 'colour revolutions', and has begun cooperating with the Belarusian authorities more actively than before.

The West's goal of overthrowing the "last dictatorship of Europe" remains intact, however the West's agents are now ready to compromise with President Lukashenka. The main condition for compromise is Belarus’ refusal to make a military alliance with Russia. A period of warm relations between the West and Belarus will follow with a confrontation, with the priority being to rip Belarus away from its alliance with Russia. The situation of neutrality in external relations being imposed on Belarus by the West means that it has to end its union with Russia, withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union and the CSTO.

Russia 'security umbrella' has allowed Minsk to avoid Ukraine's or Yugoslavia's fates. This policy risk the stability of Belarus.
