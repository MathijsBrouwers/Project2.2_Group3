Buzzfeed and Bellingcat deliberately spread anti-Russian  disinformation. Buzzfeed’s strategy is to spread false information in order to get the mainstream media to discuss an issue, to whip up scandals and influence public opinion. Bellingcat’s “investigations” of cases such as the MH17 downing and the Skripal case have intentionally spread disinformation. Both Buzzfeed and Bellingcat (and The Insider) receive funding from government and non-government organizations that are hostile to Russia.
