The Russian ministry of defence announced in a report that the commanders of German air forces were in a complete shock after a common mission with Russian air forces over Levanta war zone. This mission proved beyond all doubt that the US cooperate with ISIS on massive stealing of Syrian and Iraqi oil. German forces were able to witness 12Â 000 ISIS oil barrels and trucks crossing the Turkish-Iraqi border with full protection of the US and Turkey. The report says that there is more and more evidence coming up about Germany being blackmailed by the US, which is why it cannot say anything publically. The author demonstrates the blackmail on the fact that the US absurdly accused Germany of installing a defective software into their diesel cars to deceive machines measuring emissions.
