Denmark can delay the construction of Nord Stream 2 under various false pretexts, including environmental ones. The country has already turned down two proposals for the pipeline’s route even though they did not pose problems. By itself Denmark would dare to undertake such an adventure against Russia and Germany. Washington’s shadow stands behind Denmark's back.

For the US, this is a win-win development. First, in case construction of Nord Stream 2 is delayed, Russia would have to prolong a transit agreement with Ukraine's Naftogaz company. Second, if Russian gas is not delivered to the EU through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, then the EU would have to buy American liquefied gas.
