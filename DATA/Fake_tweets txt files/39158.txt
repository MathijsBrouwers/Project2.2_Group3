Kiev wants to make the Sea of Azov accessible to NATO forces and Ukraine could be responsible for the naval incident in the Straits of Kerch. Russia's actions were entirely legitimate. According to the data of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ukrainian ships had approached the Straits without any warning, had not waited for the Russian pilot and had not complied with the indications of the border guards, thus violating the legislation. The provocations may have continued throughout the day, leading the Russian side to open fire, injuring three Ukrainians and stopping the ships.
