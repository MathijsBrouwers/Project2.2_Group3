Mad World News 
Barack Obama is delusional. While he’s campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the FBI is investigating clear evidence that indicates he is guilty of treason. These idiots, Obama and Hillary, are in denial, running around the country and droning on about “hope and change” when the cat’s out of the bag. New evidence could put Obama in prison right next to Hillary, and Americans couldn’t be happier. 
No one is above the law, but Hillary and her crime cartel thought that they were. Now, Obama is facing his worst nightmare as the FBI is also gunning for him. Shocking new revelations came from Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, who reports that Huma Abedin spilled the beans on Obama: 
“One of the key things we’ve learned in the FBI interviews, known as 302s, came from Clinton aide Huma Abedin . She told the FBI investigators that every time Hillary Clinton’s personal [email] address changed, they would update the White House so that the president could continue receiving Hillary Clinton’s emails on his high security devices, including his Blackberry.” 
Listen to the shocking report below: 
Herridge went on to explain , “The reason that matters is that that is evidence that goes to knowledge of the White House [Obama] of this personal system [Hillary’s home-based server] and the changing addresses. So, this is something where the president and the White House clearly have a horse in the race and a stake in the outcome [FBI investigation].” 
This is exactly what happened to former president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal , except no one made money and there was never any risk to national security. So, as far as degree of damage done, Hillary and Obama put American lives at risk and allowed our enemies access to our top secrets — and that’s treason.
