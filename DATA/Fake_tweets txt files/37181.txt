A Swedish professor of Applied Behavioral Science suggested that one should consider cannibalism and start eating human flesh. According to him, this could save the planet from climate change.

In an interview with TV4, Magnus Söderlund, professor emeritus and director of the Consumer Marketing Center at the Stockholm School of Economics, spoke in favour of a diet based on human flesh.

According to him, eating human flesh could help fight climate change if the global community accepted this idea. However, Söderlund indicates that the main obstacle to this proposal is the taboo surrounding the consumption of dead humans because most people are "slightly conservative" when it comes to eating foods they are not used to.
