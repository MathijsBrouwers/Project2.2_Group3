The poisoning was meant to turn public attention away from Theresa May's Brexit-associated problems and to demonize Russia. Theresa May herself probably ordered the Skripals' poisoning. No evidence of Russia's involvementÂ in the Skripals' poisoning was produced. All accusations against Russia turned out to be groundless. There was no certainty concerning the form of the poisonous substance. If Novichok had been brought to Salisbury, its entire population would have died. Documents published by hacker group Anonymous prove that the poisoning was a distraction.
