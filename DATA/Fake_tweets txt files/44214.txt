For the past 15 years the US government has deliberately destabilised Eritrea by supporting terrorism, proxy wars, regime-change and sanctions in order to provoke massive migration flows of young Eritreans to Europe. The US aims to empty Eritrea of young people in order to invade it more easily and to punish Eritrea for not agreeing to host a US military base in the Dahlak Islands.

The following organisations are complicit in the US’s forced migration strategy in Eritrea: UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch. These organisations attract ever-greater funding thanks to the increase in migrations flows of Africans towards Europe.
