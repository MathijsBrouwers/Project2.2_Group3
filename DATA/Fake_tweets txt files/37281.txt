Climate activists, world leaders, and the complicit Western media have been quick to link the ongoing Amazon wildfires to man-made climate change and the apocalyptic environmental consequences of human activity. They have even blamed the pro-industrial policies of Brazilian President Bolsonaro for accelerating the Amazon's demise.

Although studies show that the global occurrence of wildfires is dropping and that human activity has actually helped offset their impact on global climate, environmental campaigners and politicians continue to insist that only the imposition of a benevolent green dictatorship can save our planet from destruction. The Green New Deal, for instance, calls for the abolition of all air travel and stipulates government-overseen wealth redistribution programs beyond anything the communists of the 20th century could dream of.
