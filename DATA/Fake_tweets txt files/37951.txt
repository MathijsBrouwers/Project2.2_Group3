The European Union is “committing suicide” by letting in the invading hordes from the Middle East and North Africa. Why are the European elites so insistent on ramming “tolerance” down the throats of their citizens and replacing them with imported barbarians? The Europeans conquered their own medieval nature, but then reimported it by allowing mass migration.

The new, emasculated Western European Man is unable to push back against it; nor can their governments, whose leaders are forced to abide by the same cultural codes of tolerance, political correctness and compulsory kindness. But the Eastern European Man, only temporarily frightened into acting tolerant and emasculated, will not stand for any of this for much longer. His medieval nature is still quite close to the surface, while their Western neighbours have placed theirs in museums and various other tourist traps.
