NATO was formed to confront the Soviet Union. There is now neither the Soviet Union nor the Warsaw Treaty, that is, the military alliance established in response to the creation of NATO. However, NATO is still present and even expanding. At the moment of its formation, the Alliance included 12 countries, but the number of members now is 29, while the total military spending of the alliance exceeds 70% of global military spending. Today we must start from the fact that NATO expansion and infrastructure development near the Russian border represent one of the potential threats to our country's security.
