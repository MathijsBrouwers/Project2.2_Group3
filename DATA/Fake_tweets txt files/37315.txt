The commemorative events on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in Warsaw show that, even after the Charter of Paris of November 1990, no one wants an understanding with Russia because Russia is denied its rightful place at the common "European table". (...) The way the event in Warsaw is organised betrays peace for Europe.

Russia is not invited to Warsaw on 1 September 2019. Others are invited, although the American ambassador in Warsaw in 1939 did not pass on his knowledge of the Stalin-Hitler Pact to the Polish government. (...) They wanted the war under all circumstances, and yet they are invited prominently.
