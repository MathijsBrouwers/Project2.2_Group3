Trump being Trump, he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance Republicans had of taking advantage of the email story. 
Trump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in New Hampshire by claiming that the FBI’s reopening of the investigation was “bigger than Watergate.” 
The Republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged.

Trump said, “But, with what I’ve just announced, previously, it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? The FBI. I think they’re going to right the ship, folks. I think they’re going to right the ship, and they’re going to save their great reputation by doing so.” The speculation is that the FBI is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that Hillary Clinton did nothing wrong. 
Trump and the Republicans are jumping to some conclusions. They know that Clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. They are assuming that the FBI is going to find evidence that Hillary Clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting Trump elected. 
Trump has no political skills, and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop. The Republican nominee destroyed any hope that the GOP had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold. 
The email scandal isn’t going to help Republicans. It hasn’t before, and it won’t now, but Trump’s over the top incompetence has killed any boost that Republicans might have gotten from the story.
