The US Senate Intelligence Committee's final report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections offers no evidence, but many reheated allegations and allusions by so-called experts who have themselves now been exposed as the actual election influencers.

Not surprisingly, the "results" of the report are cited as conclusive evidence that the Democrats were right and President Donald Trump wrong about 2016, Russia, Ukraine and the US presidential elections.

The problem is that the committee provides no concrete evidence for its statements - just allegations.

Since Hillary Clinton blamed "Russian hackers" in July 2016 for the revelations about corruption within the DNC, the Washington establishment has been eager to blame Moscow for all the evils of the US political system, real or imagined. The Senate Intelligence Committee's report seems to be nothing more than an attempt to warm up the long-cooled corpse of a conspiracy that the Mueller report should have buried and left to rest in peace.
