Recently the confrontation between president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and minister of interior Arsen Avakov, represented by Ukrainian national battalions, has entered a new phase. Negativity is accumulated, the dialogue is avoided by the sides, a formation of an enemy image are already there. Guerilla warfare and subversive acts are coming, and any accident can provoke a new coup which will give a start to a new stage of Ukraine's disintegration.

The entry of Zelenskyy in power became a catalyst of conflicts between Ukrainian elites. They will result in Ukraine's collapse, because even the US - and its embassy plays a colonial role in Ukraine - will not be able to restrain the conflict, given that Ukrainian elites copy the split between American elites. At the same time, the US will not allow either Zelenskyy or Avakov to be destroyed. Hence the conflict will be developing cyclically until Ukraine's complete disintegration.
