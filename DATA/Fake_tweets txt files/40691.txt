For Western Europe, the territory to the East is an annex of resources. The Europeans will not tolerate any sovereign state or territorial entity that does not feel itself an attachment to their interests. They declare a zone of their interests - this is a normal strategy - those countries, through which the oil and gas pipelines, that are feeding and supplying Europe, pass today. Now they will annex these countries under false humanitarian values and slogans.Then the disintegration of Russia will begin.
