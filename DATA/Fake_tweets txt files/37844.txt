Whilst understanding the sensitivities of the Georgians, the current occasion, which was based on a "protocol error" from the host (Georgian) side, as they later admitted, seems rather null and void for such riots.

We think this action was planned, because dozens of cameras were set up at lightning speed. People who came to the meeting demonstrated with pre-prepared posters with dirty, offensive, anti-Russian content. It was obvious that it was not the orthodox forum, to which Georgia itself applied for participation, that was the cause of the riots, but an attempted coup d'Ã©tat and occupation of Parliament.
