The resignation of the Belarusian Minister for Internal Affairs Ihar Shunevich became a controversial news story. Whereas for people holding traditional views, Shunevich was a symbol of loyalty to the officer's duty, he became an object of hate and was constantly attacked by the population with liberal views.

Concerning his anti-homophobic statements, it is worth noting that no legal norms are in place in Belarus which discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

The efforts by foreign donors and embassies to establish special organisations aimed at promoting same-sex preferences are taken in Belarus as interference in domestic affairs. Moreover, in Belarusian society, where 70% of citizens are Christian believers, promotion of LGBT rights can result in the development of opposing radical sentiments. This is why the activities of the UK embassy concerning the LGBT issue were interpreted by the Ministry of Interior as a challenge to domestic security.
