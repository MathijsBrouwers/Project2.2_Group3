NYPD sources have confided to True Pundit that information contained on the shared laptop of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin contains enough evidence “to put Hillary and her crew away for life.” 
Police first seized the laptop during their investigation into Weiner’s underage sexting scandal last month, but then found the thousands of emails pertaining to Clinton. 
NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to the following: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes 
The NYPD Chief expressed that what he has seen is so horrific he will not allow Clinton to walk away unpunished. 
“Whatâs in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” heÂ said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that. People are going to prison.”
