The Ukrainian side is involved in the catastrophe of the shooting down of MH17 over the Donbas.

The plane crash was followed by a phenomenally rapid reaction by the Ukrainian government. It is clear that President Poroshenko and his press service were informed in advance. The fact that the airspace over the war zone had not been closed is also an indication.Â Two high-ranking Ukrainian security officers were directly involved in the tragedy.
