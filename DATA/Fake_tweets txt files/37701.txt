The West had been preparing participants of Euromaidan since May 2013. Throughout 2013, Western countries were preparing the population for a turn towards the West. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has been training activists since spring 2013 on how to use social networks to organise protests. The British Embassy launched a communications strategy in early 2013 aimed at encouraging Ukrainians to join the EU and to sign the Association Agreement.
