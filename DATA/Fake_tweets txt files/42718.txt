NATO military drills are a demonstration that neither Russia nor Belarus will never be friendly countries for either Vilnius or Washington. Even Lithuania will hardly be so for the U.S., it will rather be cannon fodder for American imperialism. The only viable option for Belarus and Russia is to build a common defensive alliance. It is no coincidence that lately Nasha Niva, TUT.by and other Belarusian media outlets demonstrate weakened Belarus-Russia cooperation. Generally, the whole NATO infrastructure is intended to enhance the capability of attacking Russia and Belarus. It does not necessarily mean that such assault will happen today or tomorrow, but NATO's better readiness for aggression is there.
