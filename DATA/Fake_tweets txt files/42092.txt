A Czech Maidan can occur on 17 November, when Czechs commemorate the student uprising against Nazi occupation in 1939 (and later the start of the Velvet Revolution in 1989). This year, this day will mark a choice between the Czech Republic becoming independent or a German colony. The "wrong" choice may result in a Czech Maidan, orchestrated by foreign powers.
