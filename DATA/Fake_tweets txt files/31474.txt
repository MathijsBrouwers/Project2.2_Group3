Breaking all the breaking noise from the leftist media! Pundits, establishment scum, satanists, celebrities, filth of the Earth, party traitors and everyone who opposed Donald J Trump, bow down to the great 45th president of the United States of America!
BOW DOWN SCUM! YOU ARE ALL DEFEATED!
So far Donald Trump stands at 276 electors out of 270 needed to win the presidency. Counting is still going on in some states such as Arizona, New Hampshire, Michigan and Alaska. After counting is over in those states. Trump could very well exceed 300 electors.
This victory qualifies as a LANDSLIDE!
Donald Trump fought a long war, he was despised and hated by the media and by the establishment but he eventually won! Now its time for MAGA!
First and foremost we would like to thank GOD himself for helping the light to prevail against the dark! After years of darkness its finally time for light.
Second we congratulate Trump himself for all the hard-work and he did work very hard, speech after speech, little pause, little sleep. He deserves the victory!
Third we would like to thank each and every single small blog, forum, youtuber, news website and ourselves of course the EU Times which stood firm WITH Trump since day 1 when he first announced and to each and every single activist who helped propel Donald Trump to victory.
Fourth we would like to thank the American voter who was smart and ignored all the noise and hate against Donald Trump!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN!
