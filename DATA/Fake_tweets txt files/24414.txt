In March, Barack Obama told CBS News he heard about Hillary Clinton’s email server in news reports. I’m sure you remember that. 
Barack Obama is going to regret this moment. 
*** NEWSFLASH: Obama lied. 
The FBI revealed in September that Barack Obama used a pseudonym to communicate with Hillary Clinton. 
*** And then there was this today. 
Catherine Herridge on FOX News reported that the Obama White House was notified 6 different times when Hillary changed her email address. 
Let me repeat that: OBAMA WAS ALERTED 6 DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HILLARY CHANGED HER EMAIL. 
Here’s the proof. 
*** This needs to go viral. 
This means that Barack Obama was in on the server situation the entire time. He was updated on it 6 times.
