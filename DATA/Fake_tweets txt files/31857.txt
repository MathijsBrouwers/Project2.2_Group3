VOTING continues across America today as the American electorate seeks to vote in a new president, and while the identity of the 45th president of the United States of America is not yet know, what is known is that Americans are currently Americaning the shit out of the American election. 
“So many people are staunchly opposed to one another and their preferred candidate, but they are always in agreement that they will do their level best as Americans to America the shit of the election,” election expert Sebastian Cumstard explained to WWN. 
“The beautiful thing about America is that no matter your race, creed, class or gender, whatever your barely researched opinion is, it will likely lead you to vote in an almost violently patriotic manner or to use the technical term it will see you ‘America the shit out of it'” added Cumstard.

Asked to expand on what they meant by this, some 98% replied by screaming ‘America’ as loudly as humanly possible. 
The world will continue to watch on helplessly with many confirming they will not be able to sleep until they know who America feels can America America the most; Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
