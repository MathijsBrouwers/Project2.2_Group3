Regarding the federal Judge's decision noted:
Yes, he correctly notes that oil is different than gas pipelines from a regulatory standpoint, BUT, the Clean Water Act permits required for stream crossings can be DENIED by EPA and/or the State regulatory agency.
If I were ND State agency head or US EPA Regional Administrator, I could do that and make it stick legally.
The regulatory framework is seriously flawed, but still is sufficiently powerful to kill these pipelines - IF it were enforced vigorously, which is is NOT.
Activists need to get up to speed on these issues and start holding State regulatory agencies, Governors and EPA accountable.
