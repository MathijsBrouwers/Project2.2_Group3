In his interview with The Guardian, John Scarlett, former Chief of the UK Secret Intelligence Service MI6, allegedly disclosed a three-stage strategic plan of the United States and the Great Britain aimed at Russiaâ€™s fragmentation. John Scarlett claims that the first stage of the plan envisaged the deployment of military and intelligence bases around South Ossetia and involvement of security officers. The second stage envisaged bringing of radical Islamists to power in Chechnya, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Circassia. As for the third stage, it was planned to provoke a fake conflict in Ukraine, but Moscow managed to protect the country against this threat.
