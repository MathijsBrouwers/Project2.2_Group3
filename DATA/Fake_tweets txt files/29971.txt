Things that make you go hmmmm….,” responded another Twitter user. The African-American voter said he complained that the polling station appeared to be using old machines. “I just thought about it, I didn’t have to show ID to vote either,” he subsequently tweeted. 
CBS News reports that Trump voters in Pennsylvania are seeing their votes switched to Hillary Clinton. 
“I went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,” Bobbie Lee Hawranko said. As we reported earlier , Trump supporters are also seeing voting machines change their votes in Philadelphia while others have been harassed.
