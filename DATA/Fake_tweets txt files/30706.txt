And that’s not all. Business Insider reports that its top story Tuesday was “ How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizen.” On Google Trends, the term “ Canadian immigration ” began to spike at 10:23 p.m. Tuesday, right around the time the networks and Associated Press called the key swing state of Ohio for Trump, as did the term “ Canada .”
Even the Canadian national anthem was trending; “ O Canada! ” has benefited from Americans perhaps eager to learn their new country’s national song.
