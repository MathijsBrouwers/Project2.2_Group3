The specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are bodies that, in fact, were created by agents of foreign influence who acted under the orders of foreign embassies. Today these institutions are managed by foreign embassies. They were created in order to punish all those who are not pro-American.
