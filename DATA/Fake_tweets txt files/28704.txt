[Ed. – If you’re wondering if we’ve ever had to do this with a NATO ally before, the answer is no. This is what our vice president would call a big effing deal.] 
The State Department is ordering family members of employees posted to the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul to leave because of security concerns. 
In a statement issued Saturday, the State Department says the decision is based on security information indicating extremist groups are continuing aggressive efforts to attack U.S. citizens in areas of Istanbul where they reside or frequent. 
The Consulate General remains open and fully staffed. The order applies only to the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, not to other U.S. diplomatic posts in Turkey.
