One of the best things about my childhood was that I lived within walking distance of a library. It wasn’t a huge library, but it fed my hunger for escape and story. 
Because of this, I have a special place in my heart for librarians. I’m pretty sure I was a hella annoying kid (none of us really changes over time….we only become more fully what we are. – Anne Rice). But our librarian never let on if I annoyed her. Or maybe she was just the kind of saintly librarian who enjoyed kids who liked learning? I dunno. But we’d go and spend hours, whole days even. It was Nirvana!
