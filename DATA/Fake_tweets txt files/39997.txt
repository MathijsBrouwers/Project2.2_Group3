He was awarded for supporting pederasts.

He should not to take part in this Sodomise ceremony.

We call on Kashia not to accept a gift bestowed by pederasts and their bosses and to be remembered as a champion of the continent and not as a champion of Conchitas.

Some have really decided to annihilate and degenerate us! What these sick people want from us, I donâ€™t understand! We are forced that a man should sleep with a man and a woman with a woman! What do they want, sorry but they even start pederastisation of football.
