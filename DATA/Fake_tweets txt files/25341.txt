The hoax “rape lawsuit” which a liar attempted to bring against Trump, has been dropped. 
Chalk it up to another lie perpetuated by the left and #NeverTrump idiots in a desperate attempt to take down Donald Trump. 
From Politico : 
A woman who accused Donald Trump of repeatedly raping her two decades ago when she was a 13-year-old aspiring teen model has again dropped a federal lawsuit over the alleged assaults. 
The accuser, identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym “Jane Doe,” was expected to appear at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday, but that appearance was abruptly canceled. 
Let this be a lesson to the left and #NeverTrump – all of your fake accusers have been debunked and shamed.
