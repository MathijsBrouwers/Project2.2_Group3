Bloomberg wrote about Vladimir Putin's insidious plot concerning Belarus and referred to an anonymous source close to the Kremlin. The anonymous source is a trick, as in reality it does not exist. Anything can be published based on references to the "sources close to the Kremlin". Bloomberg does its best to turn Belarus and Russia against each other to prevent the establishment of the Union State between the two countries. Bloomberg will continue writing about political and economic disagreements between Belarus and Russia, and its future allegations will be based on the "sources close to the Kremlin". It was indeed Bloomberg who started an information war against Russia, and it was Bloomberg who was at the head of all international conflicts.
