The Western media suddenly admits that there was no sarin in Douma, Syria, and chemical attacks as well. BBC admits that reason for bombing Syria was fake, and the video from the hospital was fabricated.

"This video was published in April 2018 by the White Helmets cooperating with the Islamists, after which the United States, with the support of Britain and France, launched over a hundred cruise missiles in Syria".

"This is all the exact copy of the events that were developed around Iraq before the start of aggression against a sovereign state".
