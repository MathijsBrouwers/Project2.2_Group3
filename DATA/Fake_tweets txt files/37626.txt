President Trump's "deep state" foes who are obsessed with doing anything that they can to thwart his desired rapprochement with Russia by encouraging Ukraine to continue the failed civil war as a proxy conflict against Moscow's national security interests which they hope would indefinitely perpetuate the New Cold War.
