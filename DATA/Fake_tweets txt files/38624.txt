Climate activists don't appreciate the progress their parents and grandparents have made with sweat on their faces. They don't realise that they are so well off right now, not because of their own diligence, but because of this legacy, which they want to destroy in the name of green faith. Ecologism, not ecology!

It is precisely thanks to previous generations that university occupiers and fans of the terrifying Greta can travel easily, enjoy technological progress, and democracy as well.
