Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, tweeted Wednesday night he will vote for Donald Trump for President. He went on to say, “Hillary IS that bad”, and he should know. He has worked on the Benghazi Committee, as well as the investigation into her use of a private email server and the deletion of more than 30,000 emails from that account. 
Chaffetz is the Representative from Utah, and he is as reputable as anyone you will find in today’s corrupt government. He did find confusion as to whom he would vote for, as he was disappointed with Trump when the widely distributed “sex tape” came out. It threw him, but he simply cannot vote for Hillary, as he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt she is bad to the bone and will lead this Country into further destruction. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA.
