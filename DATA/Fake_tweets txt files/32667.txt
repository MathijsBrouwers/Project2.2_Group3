Bill Still – Good evening, I’m still reporting on Trump. We don’t know her name. We don’t know where she lives. All we know is she is married with at least two children. She put her kids in the car and then decided to record what was in her heart as she was heading out to vote. 
I’m still reporting from Washington. Good day.
