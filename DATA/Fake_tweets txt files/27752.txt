Kp Message 10-27-16… “Passage through the Storm Waters” 
Although I often post here a variety of “news type” things here, there’s so much that I have no understanding of, and perhaps never will. I feel I do not belong to the outer “crap appearances”, or the things that are seemingly so “out of whack” with the Light of us all. And I also am not aligned with the idea that “I am responsible for (and caused) it all.” Sorry… no. 
This particular time upon this planet often feels like we are dealing with “the storm waters”… winds blowing one way, then another way, waves coming from one direction, then another direction, and who knows what is going on with the political waves. Enough already. 
But as I’ve learned by bodysurfing at Sandy Beach, on a strong trades swell day, it is possible to flow with the rapid changing waves, and even catch a few, kick out, and get ready for the next one(s). And truly enjoy the experience of the “going with the flow”. We all have tools, and we all can find our place in this time of massive transformation. 
Also I remember that even though there is this massive transformation going on, this is simply a passage… we’re passing through. We will not be living in “the Storm Waters” every moment. 
There’s nothing wrong with not being able to relate to this, but some can sense what’s happening, and it is quite big. 
So we’ll see where it all goes. In the end, BEing and SHINING our Lights, whatever they are, is perhaps the most valuable thing we can do to pass through those “Stormy Waters”. 
Aloha, Kp
