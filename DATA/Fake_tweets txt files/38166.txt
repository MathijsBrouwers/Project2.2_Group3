Following the USSR's break-up, the West created various funds and organisations in the post-Soviet countries and began meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. The 2004 presidential elections and 2014 Euromaidan in Ukraine were examples of US' rulings on who should have power in Ukraine. Gradually, post-Soviet countries began turning into colonies of the US with various conflicts and degradation stemming from this fact.

When it comes to eastern policy, old and new EU and NATO countries have clear roles: Western European countries play masters of democracy, human rights, and European values, whereas Eastern European counties (Poland, Czechia, Romania, and the Baltic states) do dirty work by promoting disintegration, bringing tensions and confrontation along the whole perimeter of all-Russian civilisation. In fact, the real policies of the EU and US do not have anything to do with democracy and human rights. They support neo-fascists in the Baltic countries, fascists in Ukraine, followers of Ion Antonescu in Moldova, the anti-Russian regime in Georgia, so-called human rights defenders in Russia and so-called promoters of Belarusian culture in Belarus.

Integration between Belarus and Russia reproduces the USSR to some extent and counteracts the geopolitical dictate of the US. This is the reason behind the information war waged by Western media and their clients in post-Soviet countries against the Union State between Belarus and Russia. There is no alternative to integration between Belarus and Russia. Without unification, the two countries and other post-Soviet republics will not have futures.
