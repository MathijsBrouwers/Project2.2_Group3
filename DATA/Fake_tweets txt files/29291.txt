This is completely disgraceful. Obama is advocating committing VOTER FRAUD on live television as ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS are not permitted to vote.

Barack Obama has gone on record encouraging illegal immigrants to vote in the United States presidential election.
Appearing on MiTu, a YouTube channel aimed at Latino millenials, Obama was asked by the host Gina Rodriguez if undocumented immigrants should be fearful of voting. But rather than setting her straight and telling her that voting is a sacred right of citizens, and if you are an undocumented immigrant you are not a citizen, Obama actually encourages illegals to sneak into a booth somehow and vote.
How desperate are the Democrats? As the polls tighten and Hillaryâ€™s campaign lurches from one scandal to another, the president of the United States, making the rules up as he goes along, is urging non-citizens to vote.
