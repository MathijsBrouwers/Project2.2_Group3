Just before Christmas, three Arab refugees attacked two Czechs. In front of a club in Brno, a fight broke out in the early morning, when the refugees verbally attacked a girl. Two Czechs wanted to protect this girl so they got involved. They were then attacked with a knife and seriously injured by the Arabs. The attackers clearly aimed at the arteries on their throats and wanted to kill the Czechs, they failed only because of the rapid and good reaction of the Czechs.
