Ondřej Kolář, who brought up the idea of removing the monument to Marshall Konev, Prague's liberator from the Nazis, is a junior city official of the Municipal District 6 in Prague with a few supporters. That means that this international row has been set up by a small clique of municipal clerks. No one outside the Czech capital had ever heard about Ondřej Kolář. His hatred towards all Russians is gigantic. These people are idiots.
