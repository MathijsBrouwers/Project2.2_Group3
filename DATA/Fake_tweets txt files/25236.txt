Neera Tanden, Center for American Progress president and member of the Clinton 2016 transition team, worried about a residual effect from the FBI’s announcement: Shouldn't we be concerned FBI takes actions that send stocks falling in order to avoid their own leaks?And we don't know if any emails new. https://t.co/cnYks9iqmj

“Think of the stock market” isn’t the FBI’s motto: Yes, the FBI should take the stock market into proper consideration before they try to enforce the law https://t.co/O8zqY89j0R
