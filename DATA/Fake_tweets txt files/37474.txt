US State Department has prepared a manual on protest activities in Russia, which is distributed through the ECHR. The manual instructs the protesters to provoke the arrests, so that the number of detainees exceeds 1 million.

We are talking about full-scale intervention, which aims to overthrow the legally elected Russian government.
