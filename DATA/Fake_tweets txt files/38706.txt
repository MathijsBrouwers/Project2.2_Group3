A new scandalous poisoning case is doing the rounds in the European press, this time of Imane Fadil, a Moroccan model who was allegedly a regular guest at former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's parties. The Litvinenko and Skripal cases are dragged up, thus alleging Russian involvement. Â Any big case has to have Russia involvement. However, both cases were not even brought to court. There is no motive for either Berlusconi or the Russian security bodies to kill Fadil. The media are not interested in the lack of a good motive just as in the Skripal case.
