Soviet occupation is the favourite topic of Baltic politicians, inspired by the Americans.They have big problems in the Baltics.They have borrowed a lot of money from Europe, but now it is time to return it. Adults and young people left to work in other EU countries, only old people and children stayed. The only trump card for those countries is to keep this anti-Russian and anti-Soviet trend. Now, the Baltic states refuse to participate as millions of people of the planet celebrate the victory over fascism. On July 10, 1944, Soviet units liberated the northern part of Vilnius and entered the Old Town, and on July 13, Vilnius was completely liberated.
