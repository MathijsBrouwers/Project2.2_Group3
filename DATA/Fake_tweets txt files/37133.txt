G7 positions are based on the recognition of US global dominance. Canada and Italy do not have enough weight. US occupational military forces have remained in the territories of Japan and Germany since WWII. Both countries are not fully sovereign. UK and France have a very narrow avenue for taking international decisions beyond the USâ€™s position. Hence, the G7 turned into a group of Soviet-like bureaucrats led by Washington. It has not much to discuss beyond European, American, or Japanese problems. Hence, Trump's statement to bring Russia back, as discussions about Ukraine, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, or global energy security are senseless without Moscow.
