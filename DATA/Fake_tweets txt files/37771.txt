The United States is making preparations for Ukraine to launch a new provocation against Russia in the Black and Azov Seas. The international military exercises "Sea Breeze 2019" need Ukraine in order to work out a plan to seize the Russian Crimea. Washington and Kyiv also intend to exacerbate the situation and present Russia in an unfavourable light.
