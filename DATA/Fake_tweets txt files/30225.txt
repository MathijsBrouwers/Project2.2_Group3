Clinton campaign chairman John Podestaâ€™s New York office features an oil painting in which two men are preparing to eat another human.
The image, which was shown during a 2015 exposĂ¨ on the Clinton campaign headquarters by Politico, was lent to Podesta by his lobbyist brother Tony.
The painting was specifically mentioned 9 months later in an article on Podesta by Time Magazine .
â€œOn the wall in his office at Hillary Clintonâ€™s Brooklyn headquarters, campaign chairman John Podesta has an oil painting on loan from his lobbyist brother, who is an avid art collector,â€ the Time article states. â€œThe image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta.â€



Podesta explained during the interview that he regularly tells colleagues that he would prefer to be the man with the fork.
â€œItâ€™s better to be the guy with the fork than the guy on the table,â€ he said.
The image resurfaced on social media Friday after emails published by WikiLeaks revealed both John and his brother Tonyâ€™s connection to Marina AbramoviÄ‡, a performance artist known for gory and occultist performances.
Podestaâ€™s painting is incredibly similar to one of AbramoviÄ‡â€™s art displays in which she and pop star Lady Gaga eat off of a mock bloodied body.
The WikiLeaks emails specifically surrounded AbramoviÄ‡ inviting both the Podesta brothers to attend an event known as â€œSpirit Cooking.â€
â€œSpirit Cooking is an event and central ritual started by Marina AbramoviÄ‡, who is an artist known for her gory performances and occultist rituals,â€ the website Everipedia notes.
â€œThe origins of Spirit Cooking can be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley.â€
The Podestas' "Spirit Cooking" dinner?
It's not what you think.
It's blood, sperm and breastmilk.
But mostly blood. https://t.co/gGPWFS3B2H pic.twitter.com/I43KiiraDh

Video of AbramoviÄ‡ engaging in the ritual, which involves menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm, can be found online.
The hashtag #SpiritCooking trended for hours on Twitter Friday following the email chainâ€™s discovery. Clinton-supporters in the media attempted to outright deny or downplay Podestaâ€™s extracurricular activities, claiming such behavior is mundane.
The fact that those close to Clinton are engaged in such disturbing rituals should cause concern to any American who doesnâ€™t view carving Pentagramâ€™s into their flesh as â€œnormal.â€
