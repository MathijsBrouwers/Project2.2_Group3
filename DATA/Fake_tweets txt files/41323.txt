The current world follows the principle "Russians are everywhere." However, in reality, the Russians have a lot of things to do domestically given the large size of the country. Small Western countries do not have much to do, so they imagine things. They imagine Novichok, election meddling and even recruitment of the American president. If Donald Trump was the Kremlin's agent, he would use a malicious virus to destroy the system to manage the US's nuclear capability to make the US surrender within half an hour.
