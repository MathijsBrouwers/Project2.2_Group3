From the historical point of view Belarusian history is inseparable from all-Russian history. Belarus has to be in civilizational unity with Russia and the Russian World because Belarus is an integral part of all-Russian civilization. The so-called Euro-integration, Eastern Partnership and other programs of Euro-Atlantic cooperation which are imposed by the West, are unacceptable. Quasi-Euro-integration is based on a geopolitical catastrophe and the policy of external governance thanks to keeping post-Soviet space in the disintegrated state.
