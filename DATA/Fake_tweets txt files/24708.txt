With the election a little under two weeks away, former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh is all in for Trump. 
But if you thought you were anti-Hillary, you may want to think again. 
Walsh, who's made no secret about his disgust for the former Secretary of State, sent out this head-turning tweet on Wednesday: On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.You in? — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
No, it's not a parody. Walsh just said he is going to grab his musket if Trump doesn't win the 2016 presidential election. And yes, he invited others to join him. 
CNN's Jake Tapper saw the tweet and like most of us, he wanted Walsh to clarify his comments: @WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean? — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 26, 2016 
Walsh responded: @jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Others weighed in, too: — Brian Fagioli (@brianfagioli) October 26, 2016 @walshfreedom @jaketapper Doing what it takes to get your country back? It’s called voting. Never heard it referred to as “musketing” — John Blanco (@ZaBlanc) October 26, 2016 I don't think @WalshFreedom understands the meaning of "civil disobedience." pic.twitter.com/qqdX6WDbP9 — John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) October 26, 2016 
But one commenter said, “I think you got a good portion of gun owners that are with you. But seriously a musket. You might want to update your arsenal.”
