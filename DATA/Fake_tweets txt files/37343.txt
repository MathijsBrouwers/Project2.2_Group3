NATO and the "deep state" are pursuing a war-preparation policy and hinder cooperation between Trump and Putin.

The dream of the Western warmongers will come true next spring (during NATO military exercises). Just in time for the Moscow celebrations for the end of the war in 1945, the tank engines will roar across Germany and past Dresden to the east. It will be a march against Russia as the world has not seen it since the "Operation Barbarossa". The people in Russia must gain the impression that the Second World War is to be fought further during the NATO large-scale manoeuvres before the anniversary of the end of the war in 1945.

The impeachment proceedings against the American President Trump are proceeding exactly according to this timetable pattern. This is for conspiracy practitioners. The roadmap for this trial is designed to prevent President Putin and President Trump from meeting in Davos at the end of January 2020 and possibly discussing in private things that could work against the war interests of the "deep state". It is enough for the Washington warlords to imagine that President Trump could do without an interpreter from the US State Department's resistance nest. The entire absurdity of Western and, above all, NATO policy lies in this notion. There goes a presidential candidate named Trump and declares to strive for good relations with Russia.
