World News » *Breaking: Wikileaks Bombshell Reveals Collusion Between Clinton Campaign And DOJ’s Peter Kadzik 
As most of our readers assuredly are aware, yesterday the DOJ stepped in “to assist” with the FBI’s new Hillary Clinton email investigation, with the DOJ’s Peter Kadzik (a friend of the Clinton Campaign) to head up the investigation. That last fact is no longer a secret to the American Public as this new Wikileaks Bombshell reveals Kadzik sent the Clinton Campaign the following: 
“Heads up. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.” 
From ZeroHedge : 
On Monday we were the first to note that Podesta’s friend Peter Kadzik was the DOJ representative chosen to head up a “thorough” review of the new Huma Abedin emails as revealed by a letter he wrote to Congress. Given Kadzik’s personal relationship with Podesta, it seemed like a “convenient” choice for the Clinton campaign. 
In the letter to Congress, the DOJ writes that it “will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,” assistant attorney General Peter J. Kadzik writes in letters to House and Senate lawmakers. 
“Ironically”, that is the same Peter Kadzik who has proven his “impartiality” in multiple WikiLeaks emails including this newly released bombshell in which Kadzik provides a very helpful “heads up” about Hillary’s email server investigation. 
Sure, who needs an independent investigator…this guy will do just fine.
