It is not a coincidence that a video about Austrian vice-chancellor was leaked 4 days before the European elections and that it was leaked by German, not Austrian media.

Merkel declared war to right-wing parties. Manfred Weber announced that he would fight anyone who is destroying Europe, including nationalists and populists. Austrian intelligence was turned into outcast in Europe by the Germans. It is all related and very similar to a provocation orchestrated by the secret service.

German intelligence is conducting surveillance not only on German right-wing parties, but also those abroad. When right-wing parties came to power in Austria they stopped the German surveillance. Therefore it is logical that there was a special operation to destroy the government of Austria.

Perhaps in one year we will learn whether it was an operation to diminish popularity of Â the right-wing forces in Austria and German, or if this was operation to destroy the government in Austria. Who is responsible? Germany is really prominent in this, in creating these informational waves.
