EU member states are lobbying for the adoption of a European directive on the voluntary destruction of vineyards in some countries, including Romania. This happens under the pressure of countries with centuries-old traditions of viticulture, especially French farmers, who suffer from overproduction and believe that their incomes in the EU market have significantly decreased because of competition with the newcomers. This is one of the most revealing examples of how the EU imposes its rules to those countries where there is corruption and "obedient" politicians.
