Today Notre-Dame died. Of course, the reason of "ignition" will be identified later, but the real reason is already apparent. France became a country in which people smash the windows of boutiques just because they are expensive, where taxes are so high that successful people leave. This is connected through karma with the fact that the magnificent cathedral, which very clearly represented impudent luxury and demanded more work than 36-hour-week, was burned down intentionally.

What will be constructed on this place in a country where now statistically every 5th citizen is named Muhammad?
