Following the 2014 coup and finding itself under complete control of the West, Ukraine started disrupting all economic ties with Russia as was ordered by the West. In accordance with the Association Agreement with the EU, Ukraine opened its markets for the EU products but faced EU's closed markets or minimal import quotas. As a result, many Ukrainian branches of the economy started stagnating. After the 2014 coup, Ukraine essentially ended being a state and turned into a former country. Historically Ukrainian territories were part of Rus', then Russian empire, and then USSR, which is a big Russia. Since 2014 the West, a global Russian enemy succeeded in reformatting Russia's former part, non-country Ukraine, into Anti-Russia.

In a new Anti-Russian Banderstadt, less than 2 percent of the population, which holds Nazi and neo-fascist views, keeps under control the rest of the population, zombieing them with Russophobia and pushing for war with Russia. Even Volodymyr Zelenskyy cannot deal with them. In other words, Ukraine has turned into a weapon of the vicious enemy and a hostile arena towards Russia and all Russian people. The Anti-Russia existence close to Russia's borders is wrong and strategically harmful for Russia. Russia will not tolerate it and, sooner or later, this hostile springboard will be destroyed. Russians of Novorossiya, Malorossiya ('Little Russia'), and other historic regions will not leave to Russophobic Ukraine any territories.
