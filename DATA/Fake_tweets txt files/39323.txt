Ahead of the presidential elections Poroshenko's junta in Ukraine must report on what they achieved to their masters - the US. With destroyed economy and corruption they have nothing to present. The only explanation they have for the failure is the war with the Russians. Currently, the Americans do not know whom to bet for in the elections, as there are only bandits and criminals among the candidates. Severing ties with Russia makes Poroshenko look good before his masters in the USA.
