The German media and NATO portray Russia as an enemy.

Only recently the claim: “Russian secret service possibly involved in murder of exiled Georgian” was to be read in Hamburg's “Spiegel”. The murderer was also called a “suspect”. The article is teeming with “should” and “possible”. As almost always when it comes to the Russians, the subjunctive triumphs over journalism.

This latest campaign, one of the many, many in a constant fire of suspicion against “the Russians”, raises the question of who will benefit from it. (...) NATO, Trump (...) need the enemy for the turnover of their friends in the economy and for political power: Nothing makes voters dumber than an evil enemy image.
