Elections are a tool used to hide mistrust of political authorities and confidence in their own strength. Parliaments are corrupt, be it through the contributions by lobbyists or through the misguided belief that one can actually make a difference by voting in parliamentary elections. This self-deception is the cheapest corruption.

Elections to the European Parliament have been held since 1979. The Parliament's chief purpose has always been the stabilization of financial rule, the best example of which is the Euro-coup. If you cast a vote in the EU Parliament elections, you will never get it again.
