The Belarusian opposition supports pro-Western propaganda and blames Lukashenko and Putin for everything. It misrepresents the situation alleging that American missiles in Poland are directed against Lukashenko and Putin personally. Hence, it calls people to take part in protests and to overthrow the dictatorship, otherwise the missiles will strike ordinary people. This is slave's rhetoric because the missiles are targeting all, including opposition members.

Instead of protesting against it, the opposition asks for more American missiles against own people. The opposition treats the Belarusian people as cannon fodder and disrespects it to the extent that this can provoke a global war. Even in case of real military actions, the opposition will be vehemently arguing that the West is good while Russia is bad. Belarusian independent media will support any American military provocation launched from the Polish territory.
