“If the objective is purely to undermine the Benghazi hearings, I think these spots will certainly help do that.” 
“Maybe I’m on my own here, but fwiw: I fully heard what HRC was saying, and understand the case for doing this – but I think it would be a mistake to pull down the spots we just went up with in IA/NH and make the entire dialogue about scandal/hearings/email.” 
“All three TV firms are script writing, we’ll review drafts tomorrow afternoon. Research had pulled for us some of our best news clips.” 
“The trick, of course, is to connect Benghazi to emails in a way that’s credible.” 
“…we really need to understand whether voters will believe that we can credibly conflate Benghazi and emails.”
