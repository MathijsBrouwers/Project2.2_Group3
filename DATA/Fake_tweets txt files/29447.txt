Shortly after the story first broke in March 2015 that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account and homebrew server during her tenure as secretary of state, the Democratic nominee went into damage control. Her first public remarks came in the form of a press avail at the U.N. , where she told reporters: 
[W]hen I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. 
She went on to emphasize that everything she did was above board and according to Hoyle. 
But despite her assurances — and perhaps as a direct consequence of her propensity for lying — the story refused to go away. Questions arose about whether any of the emails transmitted from or to her personal account contained classified information, which she vehemently denied. 
Now, thanks to WikiLeaks, an email written by her campaign’s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri , has emerged that suggests Clinton’s denial may have been less than forthright. The email is dated May 22, 2015 and addresses the candidate’s demeanor at another press event: 
The highlighted portion of the text seems pretty conclusive in its confirmation that her campaign team and Clinton herself knew at that early date that some of the communications in her private account had indeed contained classified data. 
Clinton has still never admitted, despite evidence to the contrary unearthed by the FBI, that she used her email to conduct affairs of state. Perhaps now she will?
