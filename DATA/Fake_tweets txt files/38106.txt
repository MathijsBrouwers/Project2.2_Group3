Romanian, Polish and Hungarian irredentists pin their hopes on the imminent collapse of Ukraine and its subsequent defragmentation, which will allow them to snatch off a piece of "Ukrainian pie".

Ukraine, which has lost its sovereignty and political subjectivity, will be easily sacrificed for current political expediency, as has already happened to the countries of the "third world" more than once.


Bessarabia, formerly owned by Russia, was occupied in 1918 by Romanian troops. The Romanian expansion, unlike the Hungarian one, is of a creeping type - without any special statements and scandals.
