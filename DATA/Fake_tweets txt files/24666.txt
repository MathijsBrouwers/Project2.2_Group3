If you were thinking this election couldn’t get any more ridiculous, just watch this interview between Sarah Palin and Bill O’Reilly on Sunday’s episode of The O’Reilly Factor. 
Palin has been largely absent from the campaign trail in recent months, even skipping the Republican National Convention, but she has still been a very vocal supporter of Trump. Judging from her Facebook page, one might even assume that she is “hot, hot, hot for Trump!” since she enjoys using that phrase so much. That tone was evident in her interview with O’Reilly when she mentioned that she heard Bill saying earlier that maybe the “Trump momentum” had slowed down. 
“You’re not in Michigan, then,” Palin said, “cos they are hot, hot, hot for Trump!” 
O’Reilly, with uncharacteristic fairness, points out that Hillary Clinton is sill leading in the polls: 
“The polls say that Clinton’s up by five. Are you willing to make a prediction that Trump will carry Michigan this time around?” 
Palin’s response to that is so mind-bogglingly crazy, that you just have to watch it for yourself. And it doesn’t end there. Here’s the full video:
