The Eurovision 2017 song contest that is to take place in Kyiv will be a Satanic ritual symbolising the destruction of the common Russian and Ukrainian history as a single nation. Its goal is to reorient Ukraine towards the West and enslave it. Moreover, the contest will take place on a formerly holy site, the St. Sophia Cathedral - Ukraine's main Orthodox cathedral.
