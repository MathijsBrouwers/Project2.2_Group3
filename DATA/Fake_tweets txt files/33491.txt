An amazing (but nearly 90% censored) Foreign Intelligence Service report circulating in the Kremlin today states that the Antarctica “guardians” swiftly retaliated against the United States this past week by “creating unleashing” a massive earthquake after the Obama regime sent “without invitation or permission” its Secretary of State John Kerry to initiate contact with them in the “barrier zone” that’s forbidden by all “known protocols” in dealing with these “entities”.
