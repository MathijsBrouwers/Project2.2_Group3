The Baltic States are demonizing Russia, blaming it for occupation, demanding reparations, and brainwashing young generations that there is an enemy in their neighborhood. They are trying to erase from memory every mention of Russia and the Soviet Union. They are bothered by monuments for the soldier-liberators who saved the Baltics from fascism.

Today they also want to erase the great sports achievements and all memory of the USSR around the world.

The main topic of debates in the Lithuanian parliament is a sports jersey. They are calling upon all of the world to prohibit Soviet symbols. Russophobia is the main export of Lithuania.
