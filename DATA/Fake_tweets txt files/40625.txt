No one will ever believe that [the West, the US and the Ukrainian oligarchs] did not understand what [they] were doing when removing Yanukovich, who had been supposedly thieving around, and then replacing him with the supposed “honest Poroshenko”. Everyone knows what the Ukrainian oligarchs have been doing in Ukraine during 25 years! They were robbing this country! This whole country has been designed in order to get rich. [...] It is a monstrous deception of the population of the former splinter of the Soviet empire, by the Americans together with their [Ukrainian] oligarchs! It will end with coming to power of the most radical gang of Ukrainian nationalists. It is all directed against Russia.
