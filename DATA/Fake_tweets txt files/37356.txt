NATO intends to turn the entire country of Montenegro into its military base by "occupying" locations like Sinjajevina, Andrijevica, Berane and the border of Montenegro. The Municipality of Andrijevica has been deliberately chosen as a location for new NATO military barracks because of its proximity to the Albanian border. That is also the case with the old airport in Berane, which NATO plans to turn into its military base. The citizens of Montenegro need to resist this occupation and militarisation of the country.
