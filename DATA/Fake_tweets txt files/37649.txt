Sputnik News Agency is suffering an unprecedented persecution in Estonia. The country’s authorities unleashed a campaign aiming to block the work of Sputnik Estonia and deprive audiences of an alternative source of information on the situation of the country and the world. Estonia talks a lot about its commitments to democratic values, such as press freedom, but this case shows that it’s the opposite. The country represents a totalitarian machine unmatched in the world.
