Police truncheon anyone calling for Orgreave inquiry 01-11-16 
PEOPLE contemplating an inquiry into the ‘Battle Of Orgeave’ have been broken up by mounted police. 
South Yorkshire Police commander Roy Hobbs said: “Some of those involved were wielding extremely dangerous opinions that we managed to beat out of them with big wooden sticks. 
“I can reassure the public that none of our officers were physically hurt as the protestors were mostly old people due to the length of time they’ve been waiting for justice. 
“Over 100 officer statements were generated during the operation and will be made public just as soon as I’ve got round to writing them.” 
A formal confirmation of the decision will be published next week with a lengthy foreword to explain obscure historical terms such as ‘mining industry’ and ‘unions’.
