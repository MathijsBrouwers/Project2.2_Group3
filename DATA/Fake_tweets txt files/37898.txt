A chambrière is a long whip that animal handlers would use to command animals around the ring in a circus. Those whips are known for the loud cracks they produce, and can inflict serious injuries should they be used for hitting a disobedient animal. Everybody understands that funny man [Ukrainian president] Zelenskyy can’t navigate the troubled waters of today’s geopolitics without a foreign handler, or a chambrière, as they call handlers in the circus world. Trump just can’t help himself, seeking to provide guidance to his fellow showmen. It seems that they don’t have much trust in the ability of the clowns in Kyiv to lead the show on their own.
