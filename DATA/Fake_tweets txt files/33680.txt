Farage to act as go-between for Trump and nearest Domino’s 11-11-16 
NIGEL Farage will be Donald Trump’s high powered ‘go-between’ whenever the new president wants to eat some pizza. 
An excited Farage was summoned to New York by Trump yesterday to be appointed as one of the billionaire’s eight ‘fast food ambassadors’. 
Farage said: “It will be my job to sit down with the nearest Domino’s and talk through Donald’s approach and his priorities. They need to understand that he wants to a deal about pizza, but it has to be the right deal. 
“His claim that anchovies were only fit for Mexican rapists was campaign trail rhetoric. 
“He wants to work with anchovies, he wants to work with thinly sliced ham and he wants to work with black olives. 
“Well, maybe not black olives. Do olives come in beige? And if not, why not?”
