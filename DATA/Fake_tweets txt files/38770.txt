While the mainstream media continue to portray Venezuela as a crisis-stricken and impoverished country, the actual situation there is far from grave.

The UN claim that 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled the country is disputable; last year, school enrolment actually increased by 7%, and 120,000 Colombians settled in Venezuela.

Western media outlets focus on hyperinflation and its impact on the country's living standards, but never mention that many goods and services are still cheap.
