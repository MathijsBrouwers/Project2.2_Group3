According to “Citizens for Trump” Special Projects Director Jack Posobiec, Hillary will be getting some more rest. 
In a tweet, he simply said: “Hillary has cancelled all campaign events in FL, OH, and NC.” 
The plan is to start working in states she’s lost serious ground in — like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Michigan.
