Western liberal thought now includes advocacy of cannibalism.

Speaking at a recent culinary conference in Sweden -- the widely recognized beacon of liberalism -- Stockholm-based academic Magnus SÃ¶derlund stated that "the conservative taboo against cannibalism may change over time, if people simply try feeding on human flesh."

The liberal professor said that cannibalism could be a means of fighting climate change, given that human flesh is much more environmentally friendly than beef.
