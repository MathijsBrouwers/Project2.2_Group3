Dear patient readers, 
Lambert and I recognize that the caliber of reporting from both the MSM and independent news outlets has in many cases moved in a crazypants direction as Election Day nears. Unfortunately, the commentariat has taken far too much of this up, as in has featured links to dodgy stories and theories and has treated them with far more dignity than they warrant. 
We have shut down comments entirely when the quality has decayed too far or they have become too fractious. We hope not to have to do that, but in the last week alone, we’ve had to rip out two entire comment threads, something we are extremely loath to do. That sort of thing should happen at most once a year, not with anything approaching this frequency. 
This site has policy impact. We have spent far too many years building that to put it at risk. We lose credibility with some of the discussions that have been taking place recently. Please use better discernment as to whether the topic you’d like to chew over really belongs here, as opposed to Facebook or Zero Hedge.
