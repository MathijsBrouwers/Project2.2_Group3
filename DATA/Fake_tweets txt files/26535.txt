'All About Jesus' shirt sparks school uproar Legal action threatened over 'hostility toward religious beliefs' Published: 6 hours ago 
(HOUSTON CHRONICLE) — A Dallas Fort-Worth high school that initially refused to print a religious logo on their sports jersey has changed its mind after receiving a letter threatening legal action from a religious advocacy group. 
At the beginning of the school year, Texas Flower Mound High School was searching for potential sponsors for its competitive bass-fishing team. For a donation of $200, a company would have their logo displayed on the team’s website and jersey for four years. 
In early September, Wess Jones, the owner of a boat repair company called 1st Choice Marine and parent to a member of the high school’s bass-fishing team, responded to the offer. Jones’ company logo, a picture of a boat surrounded by red lettering that read “It’s not about us, it’s all about Jesus,” was rejected by the school.
