In 2017, 22,000 sexual crimes were registered in Sweden, 7,370 of them rapes. 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were born outside the European Union, and in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born sex offenders was more than 80%. But the “feminist” Swedish government (according to its own denomination) ordered police not to investigate it.
