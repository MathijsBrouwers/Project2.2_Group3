For five years now the government of Petro Poroshenko has been leading a criminal war against its own citizens.Â  Despite the accusations of the Ukrainian authorities, Russia has nothing to do with the civil war in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukraine's accusations against Russia concerning Donbas are unfounded.
