According to Quinnipiac University : Four-way races which list both presidential and vice-presidential candidates, except Georgia and North Carolina, where Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot, show: 
Georgia: Trump at 44 percent to Clinton’s 43 percent, with 8 percent for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. This compares to a 47 – 40 percent Trump lead September 22; 
Iowa: A 44 – 44 percent Clinton-Trump tie, with 4 percent for Johnson and 1 percent for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump led Clinton 44 – 37 percent September 22; 
North Carolina: Clinton edges Trump 47 – 43 percent, with 5 percent for Johnson. On October 3, Clinton had 46 percent to Trump’s 43 percent; 
Virginia: Clinton tops Trump 50 – 38 percent, with 4 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. Clinton was up 45 – 39 percent September 22. 
Contrary to some Republican hopes, Donald Trump’s slide has not stopped. Trump continues to lose support with men in Iowa and Georgia. North Carolina appears to be slipping away from Trump, and the Republican nominee has blown his leads in Iowa and Georgia. 
The Trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose Florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the Republican Party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the White House in November. 
A Trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for Republicans that leads to additional Democratic Senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. Republicans could see their current record House majority gutted in a Clinton landslide. 
The election is not getting better for Republicans. The landscape is getting worse. If this polling continues for another week at the state level, Democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a Democratic White House, House and Senate being in play.
