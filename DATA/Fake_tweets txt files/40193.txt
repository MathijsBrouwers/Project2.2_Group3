Donbass was Known War Zone: MH17 Downing is the Responsibility of the Air Controller. When the plane was shot down, Donbass was a war zone and it was a known war zone, where missiles were operating, entirely capable of shooting down a commercial jet from the sky. Therefore it was the responsibly of whoever controls the air traffic in the region to reroute planes from the Donbass war zone.
