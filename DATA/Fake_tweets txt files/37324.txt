All anti-Russian publications have long relied on the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, trying to portray the Soviet Union as an “aggressor”. It cannot be called anything other than an explicit attempt to rewrite world history.

No single liberal media has stated how the Soviet Union sharply criticised Germany’s aggressive actions in Europe since 1938 and repeatedly tried to agree on a working treaty to counter German aggression. Nevertheless, England and France refused to take on specific obligations in the event of a German attack on any European state, thereby excluding the possibility of reaching such an agreement.
