Gove left wife in hotel to go out partying with 11-year-old son 31-10-16 MICHAEL Gove left his fully-grown wife alone in a hotel room while he went out partying with their 11-year-old son, it has been confirmed. Gove told his wife that and he and their son would be back when they were back, and not to wait up. A source said: “Michael and his son went out in the afternoon and had a whale of a time. They had ice creams and fizzy pop and they even managed to walk around the Natural History museum after every one else had gone.” “ They got photos of themselves with the dinosaurs and everything.” Gove and son returned to their hotel room at 11.30pm after a roller disco, all pooped out from their adventures and ready for bed. Gove’s wife Sarah Vine said: “As much as I’m annoyed that they didn’t tell me where they were going, I was happy to have them out of my hair for a few hours. Last time this happened Michael was sick from eating too many sweets.” Michael Gove then slept soundly, right through the night, only waking once after a nightmare about a tyrannosaurus rex with Boris Johnson’s head chasing him through the Houses of Parliament.
