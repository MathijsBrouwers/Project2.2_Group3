The Council of State in the Netherlands violated the law allowing to keep in secret the information concerning the MH-17 tragedy. The Netherlands military interests may be the reason for this. The Dutch investigators got the Buk missile from Georgia. And now they are busy not so much with the investigation of the tragedy, but trying to find out how this BUK can be used to shoot down "other aircrafts".
