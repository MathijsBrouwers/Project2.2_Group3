Mikheil Saakashvili's wife, who is currently running for the Mayor of Zugdidi, trades on human organs. Saakashvili brought Georgian doctors and servicemen from Ukraine who now take wounded and newly killed soldiers out of an anti-terrorist operation zone. After that, they place these soldiers in specialised transport, where they remove organs from their bodies. A now-former employee of the Ukrainian Security Service disseminated a video exposing Saakashvili and his wife of their "black transplant" activities. The EU and the US have an interest in human organ trafficking.
