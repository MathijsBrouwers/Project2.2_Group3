The world’s top banker and conspiracy master David Rockefeller, who most likely created the idea of anthropic global warming due to CO2, produced by the combustion of oil. Rockefeller was also the head of the Council on Foreign Relations that controls all medias. After Putin helped Assad to rid Syria of NATO’s terrorist groups in 2015, it was the end of the bankers’ dream of enlarging Israel. Out of the blue, continents of plastic emerged from the deep and whales suddenly started choking on straws when medias started demonizing plastic, another oil byproduct, to make the transition to electricity a priority more urgent than ever. The gullible masses are programmed to see a link between plastic and global warming, but they don’t seem to bother over the absurdity of it. Schools should start teaching the truth, instead of the science-deprived CO2 greenhouse effect and absurd anthropic global warming, or climate changes, or whatever you now want to call this theory.
