The Europeanization of the Republic of Moldova can turn into Islamisation.

Moldova surrendered its economy through the free trade (agreement) with the EU. Many important Moldovan politicians are under the influence of the Arab sheikhs. Over the past two years, there were numerous trips of leading politicians to such countries as Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia and vice versa. It seems that these countries are intensively sent to Moldova to colonize it. Thus, the Islamisation of the Republic of Moldova will take place in the near future.
