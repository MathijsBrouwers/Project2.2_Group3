The Donetsk People’s Republic is discussing opening five new representative offices in EU countries similar to the one already established in Czech Republic. This was announced by the acting minister of foreign affairs of the self-proclaimed republic, Natalya Nikonorova.  
Nikonorova recalled that the DPR’s first representative office is already successfully working in Czech Republic and a program for its activities until the end of the year has been worked out.  
“We are very grateful to Mrs. Nela Liskova, our representative in the Czech Republic with whom we’ve worked in this direction, as well as the citizens of the Czech Republic, who are not indifferent to us,” the DPR’s foreign minister expressed thanks. 
“Now we plan to open several more such centers in Europe. In total, around five are under development for now,” Nikonorova reported. 
The diplomat remarked that there are several challenges facing the DPR on this matter. “Not all states and not all governments in Europe are friendly and sympathetic towards the DPR. But we are working through the laws of every state in order to open our centers there in accordance with state legislation, so that there would be no possibility to reproach us,” she stated. 

Nikonorova also expressed hope that attitudes towards the DPR will change for the better in many countries of Europe in the future.
