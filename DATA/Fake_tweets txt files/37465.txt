Russian philosopher and journalist Andrei Timiskov said: "Wikipedia erases information well and reformulates it to the satisfaction of the client."

"Wikipedia" has been transformed into an information source, receiving "generous donations", which are simply rewards for political tasks, culminating in the process of "sifting" the "unwanted" information. As for the donations received by the site, it is difficult to track them, as they are voluntary and the identity of the donor, either personalities or entities, may be withheld."
