Yuri Andropov created a secret plan called Golgotha in 1983. Its aim is to convince the Soviet population that the idea of socialism is the only way for human kind. The whole plan is planned for 30 years. The rebirth of the socialist society will happen during the governance of Vladimir Putin. This theory is supported by a prophecy in the Bible.
