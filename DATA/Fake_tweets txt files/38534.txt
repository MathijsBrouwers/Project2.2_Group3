France has been hit with a string of fires at Catholic churches, some of which occurred alongside acts of vandalism.

Paris’ second largest church, Saint-Sulpice, burst into flames on March 17, the fire damaging doors and stained glass windows. Police later reported that the incident had not been accidental. The story of Saint-Sulpice does not appear to be updated almost a month later suggesting that a deliberate attack of one of Paris' largest churches was not that newsworthy. 

The images of flames of Saint-Sulpice church are one example of the violence committed against Catholics. Also at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, statues and crosses were smashed and an altar cloth was burned in February.

Don't jump to conclusions before the facts come out, but keep in mind that churches have been burned across France for the last few months.

Anti-Christian attacks have sharply risen in France since the beginning of 2019.

It's unclear who is carrying out those attacks or why they did take place. But the real concern is why the French government and media generally underplay them. The true scale is still unknown.
