In 1941 attack of the Soviet Union Adolf Hitler was accompanied by multi-national forces, which can be named the European Union. The WWII was a point after which Europe stopped its existence as an independent actor on international stage. Americans not only made a fortune and solved all their domestic problems but also removed annoying competitors, i.e. the satellites of Hitler's Germany, the so called European Union, and the UK. The UK became a younger US ally if not its client. The only empire in the world remained the US, the Soviet Union cannot be called empire.
