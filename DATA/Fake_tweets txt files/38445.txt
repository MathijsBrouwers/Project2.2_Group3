Not many people were in the stadium, so the debates between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko evidently didn’t raise much interest among Ukrainian voters.

Kyiv’s Olympic stadium can host around 70,000 people, but only around 15,000-20,000 came to watch the debates.

For almost 4 million people living in Kyiv, the debates did not attract interest, despite the extensive media hysteria.
