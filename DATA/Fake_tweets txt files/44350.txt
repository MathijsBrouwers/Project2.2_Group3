U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal committed suicide jumping from the 16th floor of a psychiatric hospital shouting that the Russians were coming.

In addition, the Muller investigation on Trump's links to the Kremlin gave no results and now they intend to find the compromising evidence proving this claim.

Also, Norwegian media claims that Russian agents operated on Spitsbergen as well as on the mainland. Thus, the patriotic collection of amazing fantasies code-named "Russians are coming!" was complemented with another exhibit of "Special forces in civilian clothes."

This means that the phenomenon of the "Russian threat", "Russian trace", and "Kremlin hands" is becoming weirder and unhealthy in world politics.
