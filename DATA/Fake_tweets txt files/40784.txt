The Dutch Council of the State allowed not to make public the details of the MH-17 tragedy for two reasons. 1. The investigators have no hard facts and they are afraid that their conclusions will be disproved. 2. Ukrainian side has asked to keep it in secret because most probably Ukraine is guilty for the tragedy.
