Russia is not a threat, it is depicted as such by the West, especially the USA, which wants to oust it from the geopolitical arena. The invasion of Ukraine is not true. The USA is responsible for the rise of ISIS, mass migration from Africa, heroin addiction in Russia; they support genocide of civilians in Donbas led by neonazi banderites and Poroshenko's puppet government. Russia wants to be independent, thus it is labelled as the aggressor.
