With just 12 days until Election Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and wife, Melania, sat down to discuss the campaign's “best and worst moments” on “Good Morning America.” 
Journalist George Stephanopoulos began by asking Melania if she's still confident in her husband winning the race to the White House: 
“I see the connection with the American people and my husband, and he created a movement. The crowd and the people that are behind him are unbelievable to see.” 
But when Stephanopoulos questioned whether she'd physically get out there on the campaign trail and stump for Trump, she wasn't as confident: 
“We will see. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100% and I’m there for him every time he needs me.” 
Trump was quick to interject, saying Melania would actually give two or three speeches soon, something that seemed to be news to Melania: Image Credit: Screenshot/ ABC News 
Trump explained that her speeches would be “big” and “important”: 
“She’s amazing when she speaks. She is an amazing public speaker. She’s agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it’s going to be big speeches, important speeches.” 
It's understandable if Melania isn't eager to give speeches on the campaign trail, given what happened at the Republican National Convention in July. 
Trump's wife was publicly ripped apart after journalist Jarrett Hill pointed out the similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's in 2008. 
Though a side-by-side video comparison showed how certain passages were identical, Melania said she wrote the speech herself...with a little help from Hillary Clinton's former speechwriter. 
Despite the controversy, however, many commended her speech as “beautiful” and given “with tremendous poise”— reflecting skills Trump's campaign may benefit from in these next two weeks.
