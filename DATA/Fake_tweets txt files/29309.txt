Next Prev Swipe left/right The best halloween costume ever is this guy who dressed up as a stock photo 
@Trungles over on Twitter notes, “My little brother dressed up as a stock photo for Halloween, so he’s basically my hero” 
“I like how he also captured the “brown face white hand” blooper one sometimes sees in touched up promotional material.” comments @root2702. 
And the star of the photo Tin Nguyen says, “Getting the shutterstock logo off that image was more expensive than my whole costume.” 
@Trungles photo of his brother has gone viral with nearly 40k RTs and likes, but the star Tin Nguyen only has 100 followers himself so maybe some of our readers can bump them numbers up?
