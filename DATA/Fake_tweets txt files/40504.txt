Belgian PM Charles Micheal told the press after his meeting with Dmitrij Medvedev that the EU has had enough of self-inflicted harm and will stop supporting the sanctions.

Russia does not even have troops in the Donbas and their support for the two separatist republic is only a way to stop the Ukrainian government.
