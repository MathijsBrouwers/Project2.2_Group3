The activities of the RAND Corporation are very dangerous as it develops the most aggressive US expansionist plans, openly promoting American interference into domestic affairs of sovereign countries. The legal form of the RAND (non-profit think-tank) provides it with much broader freedom of actions in comparison to the state institutions - it makes the RAND more dangerous than the CIA and other special services. The recent RAND publications show that the American neoconservative circles (the “hawks”) are ready to destabilize half of the World in order to achieve their version of the US interests.
