The detention by the Security Service of Ukraine of the Russian tanker NEYMA in the Ukrainian port of Izmail is an act of provocation, blackmail and piracy from Ukraine.Â  The raid of the Ukrainian special services in the Black Sea was initiated by the fifth Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, and the detention itself grossly violates international norms.
