At 41-28 Trump should be leading the over all poll. Over sampling is happening somewhere. 

Here’s the thing: Bernie voters and black Americans were already Democrats. (Even if she gets 100% of them (which she won’t) she’s not broadening her numbers beyond her own party . . . which is a mere 29% of the electorate.) 
Let’s recap: 29% of the country are Democrats, 29% are Republicans and 42% are Independents. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAopWX9Mzgs 
Whoever wins Independents wins the election. 
Trump is more than doubling Hillary’s position with Independents. He’s leading in the single largest voting bloc in the country . . . yet all the mainstream media propaganda polls are pretending like Hillary’s ahead. 
(Of course she isn’t. She’s been losing this entire cycle–with the media grossly oversampling Democrats and undersampling Independents to create a synthetic paper advantage for her.) 
But things get worse for Hillary than the ass-kicking she’s getting [as a Status Quo candidate] in a Change election, vis-a-vis Independents: For a Democrat to win a national election, they have to carry 92% of the black vote. Trump is now polling between 25-30% of the black vote. (Meaning that Hillary isn’t even coming remotely close to the benchmark she’d need to win.) 
So you have Hillary hemorrhaging African-Americans, Independents and blue collar workers. 
Yet every mainstream media poll is lying to you and telling you she’s winning. 
The math doesn’t work. 
(Turn off the TV. They’re lying to you.)
