Apostle Tahar does not withold anything from us. We know what Esau will do, before he does it. TMH is guiding his Elect through these last days. Stay faithful to TMH. We must pray and not be slack. Although we are one family, remember that our test will be between each member and TMH. Build your faith now for Jacob's Trouble!!ï»¿
