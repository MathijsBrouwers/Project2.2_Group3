A wee reminder! Hope you can join us for some post-Halloween fun at our meetup on Wednesday, November 2. 
Steve in Dallas has graciously arranged for us to convene at 
Cantina Laredo 4546 Belt Line Rd Dallas, TX 75244 
We’ll start at 5:00 PM. I’m sure I’ll be there until at least 8 PM. 
Looking forward to another engaging and enjoyable event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed). See you soon! 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Notices on
