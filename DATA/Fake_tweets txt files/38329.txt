The West's primary interest concerning Belarus is to turn it into an anti-Russia country either through the organisation of a colour revolution or by military means. During NATO military exercise Anakonda'18, a Polish map was published showing the direction of NATO attacks pointing at Minsk. The map also depicts a border on the East of Poland dividing Belarus as it was before September 1939.
