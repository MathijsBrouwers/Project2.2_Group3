Sucker MCs to blame for everything 15-11-16 SUCKER MCs and their lack of dope rhymes are responsible for the state of the world, it has emerged. Researchers at the Institute of Studies found that lame-ass MCs and their wack lyrics are directly to blame for everything from the US election result to global warming. Professor Henry Brubaker said: “If it wasn’t for these so-called rappers ruining it for the rest of us straight up G’s, then Trump would never have gotten into power and Britain would still be part of the EU. “ Toblerones would have stayed the same too. “Bad things happen when fools can’t keep away from microphones.” Sucker MC Nathan Muir said: “I resent the term ‘sucker MC’, preferring to call myself a ‘differently-abled MC’. “ I’m at least better than that bear who raps Ice Ice Baby on that yoghurt advert. Now he is a sucker MC, rapping for big yoghurt companies. “ I can’t imagine anyone is going to next his next album very seriously now that he’s done that.”
