Leftists have a fondness for feces. 
In 1996, Chris Ofili used elephant dung in his painting “The Holy Virgin Mary”. (See “ NYT refuses Muhammad cartoon but publishes offensive painting of Virgin Mary in elephant dung “) 
The celebrated Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, was sneakier in his use of feces. 
Richard Johnson reports for Page Six , Oct. 30, 2016, that a new book by Thomas Girst and Magnus Resch, 100 Secrets of the Art World , reveals that Picasso painted with feces. 
Divulging “a family secret,” Diana Widmaier Picasso told the book’s authors that her grandfather, Pablo Picasso, had used the feces of his then-3-year-old daughter Maya (Diana’s mother) to paint an apple in a 1938 still life. 
Diana said, “According to him, excrement from an infant breast-fed by its mother had a unique texture and ocher color. The revulsion that this material might provoke is instead transformed into amazement as we grasp the full imagination of the artist.” Blah, blah, blah. 
Pablo Picasso was a communist and an atheist. 
From Wikipedia : 
In 1944 Picasso joined the French Communist Party, attended an international peace conference in Poland, and in 1950 received the Stalin Peace Prize from the Soviet government. But party criticism of a portrait of Stalin as insufficiently realistic cooled Picasso’s interest in Soviet politics, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death. In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: “I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting….” 
In 1940, the French government refused Picasso’s application for French citizenship on the grounds of his “extremist ideas evolving towards communism”. This information was not revealed until 2003.
