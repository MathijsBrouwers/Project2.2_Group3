Listing of Azerbaijan among the "not free" states in the 2019 Freedom House report is a result of a political order. The political framing of this organisation's annual reports is visible. This organisation's assessment of Azerbaijan is subjective. This report is a very ugly step taken to put Azerbaijan under the influence of certain foreign political and economic circles.
