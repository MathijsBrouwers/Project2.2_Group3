NATO has since buried the independence of Latvia and Lithuania, now its military forces aim to steal Belarus' independence. To prevent this, it is important to remain Russia's ally, to discuss the establishment of a Russian airbase in Belarus, to send a diplomatic note of protest to the U.S. and to send opposition politicians who support the location of US military bases in the vicinity of Belarus to court martial as national traitors. The whole Belarusian opposition celebrated the stationing of U.S. troops in Lithuania. When American tanks target the windows of their houses they feel safe.
