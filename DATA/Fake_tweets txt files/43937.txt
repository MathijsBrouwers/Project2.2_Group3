Czech President Milo≈° Zeman and his supporters know that Russia wasn't involved in causing pro-Russian uprising in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, that Russia isn't responsible for downing MH17, that the illegitimate Kyiv regime started with repressions against its own citizens who have merely defended themselves. The war was provoked by Kyiv. That's why Zeman is in general against EU sanctions. He then supports Bashar Assad and Russia, because he knows that Turkey buys ISIS oil, with support of NATO.
