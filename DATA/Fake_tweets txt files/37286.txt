The US introduced new sanctions against Russia in relation to the Skripals' poisoning. London was quick to declare Russia's responsibility for the accident. The Russian authorities denied their involvement, offered investigative assistance to the UK and demanded consular access to Skripal's daughter. All official Russian requests were ignored by the UK. The UK's laboratory in Porton Down disproved that the poisonous substance was produced in Russia.
