Pope: 'God promised the land to people of Israel' Statement seen as repudiation of UNESCO denial of Jewish ties to Temple Mount Published: 8 mins ago 
(Jerusalem Post) God promised the Holy Land to the people of Israel, Pope Francis said during a public address at the Vatican in Rome on Wednesday in a speech about migration. 
“The people of Israel, who from Egypt, where they were enslaved, walked through the desert for forty years until they reached the land promised by God,” he said. 
Pope Francis spoke just before granting a brief audience to Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoub Kara to thank him for his efforts on behalf of the Church and Christians in Israel.
