GLP Forum (godlike productions) « on: Today at 10:28:07 AM » Has anyone on here kept track much on the forum: godlike productions or GLP forum? It is not easy trying to get past the trolls but it seems to stay up with current news so I usually go there to see what the recent news was. I was posting there with a link and when I tried to post it, I was immediately banned. Anyone else go there at all on this forum? Does anyone on here know anything about this forum like who controls it? Lee51
