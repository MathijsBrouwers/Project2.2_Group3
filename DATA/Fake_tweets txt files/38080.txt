Polish anti-Soviet and anti-Russian hysteria peaked in Warsaw's refusal to invite the Russian delegation to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. This is strange because other Soviet republics including Belarus received an invitation. All Soviet countries share responsibility for the crimes of Communism but in the end, it is only Russia that is blamed. The real reason behind Warsaw’s decision not to extend an invitation to Russia is not the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, but rather the Russian ban on the imports of Polish apples.
