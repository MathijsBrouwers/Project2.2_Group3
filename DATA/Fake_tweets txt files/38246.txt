The Central Elections Committee of Ukraine concluded the elections on April 30, but Volodymyr Zelenskyy's inauguration took place on 19 of May. Experts believe that Petro Poroshenko and the Verkhovna Rada deliberately tried to delay the process. According to analysts, this way they were trying to prevent the dissolution of parliament, as well as to strengthen their positions before the parliamentary elections in late 2019.
