Ukrainians living in Crimea accuse the United Nations of making up human rights violations on the peninsula. This claim was in response to a UN resolution adopted on November 19 condemning human rights violations in Crimea which refers to Russia as the “occupying power”. The resolution is based on myths as there are no human rights violations taking place in Crimea. According to Anastasia Gridchina, the president of the Ukrainian Community in Crimea, the “UN has never visited Crimea, has not spoken to Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars about life there and is inventing myths and stories about non-existent persecution”.
