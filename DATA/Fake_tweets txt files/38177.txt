When Hungary, Moldova and Romania give passports to Ukrainians it is not considered an interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine. But when Russia does it, it is considered so. Giving passports to Ukrainians in Hungary and Romania is not seen as an aggression. Giving Russian passports in Donbas is seen as an aggression. The reason is one and very simple. “The West” does not think of Russians as people.

Hungarians and Romanians, as members of the EU are seen as masters in Ukraine, that is why they are allowed to do anything.
