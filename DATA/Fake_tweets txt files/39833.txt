The West wants to destroy Russia, just as it did in 1938 through the Munich Agreement, by using the Nazi Germany. Now it uses Ukraine as a "battering ram" to destroy "our country". The West also does this through sanctions, political pressure and NATO exercises, said Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of the magazine 'Natsionalnaya oborona', member of the Public Council under the Russian Ministry of Defense.
