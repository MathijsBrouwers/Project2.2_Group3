Norway, after Russia introduced food sanctions, could not find a substitute for the Russian fish market. "This issue is painful for the fishing industry of the kingdom". Norwegians have tried to adjust to the new situation - from the economic point of view it is the loss of a billion dollars from the fish trade with Russia. There have been attempts to find markets, great hopes have been associated with improving relations with China, but the Russian market has not been replaced.
