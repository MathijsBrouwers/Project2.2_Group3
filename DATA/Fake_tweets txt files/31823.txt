The Wall Street Journal has revealed that the National Enquirer paid $150,000 to purchase but never print the story of Republican nominee Donald J. Trump’s affair with 1998 Playmate of the Year Karen J. McDougal. 
The alleged affair happened a decade ago, It will come as a surprise to nobody that Trump and CEO David J. Pecker (yup) of American Media Inc, which owns the National Enquirer , are long time friends. 
To say that the Enquirer has supported the Trump campaign is an understatement; they’ve recently run stories alleging that his rival, religious extremist Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) had five affairs and that his father killed John F. Kennedy; that President Obama is a secret homosexual and that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had only “six months to live,” published more than six months ago. 
The knowledge of the affair will come as little surprise to most of us, seeing as Trump is an admitted philanderer and an admitted sexual predator. It’s jsut hard to understand how so many evangelicals can still endorse him, seeing as he personifies everything but “family values.” Related Items:
