The provocation with a recorded conversation between Austrian politician Heinz-Christian Strache and 'a niece of Russian oligarch' could be staged by security services of different countries. It could be Austrians themselves, where the level of popularity of the Freedom Party (FPÃ–) is a headache for some. It could be Germany which is confronted with a problem of anti-immigrant belt from Poland to Italy. Is could also be the US which dislike Austria's active participation in gas projects jointly with Russia.
