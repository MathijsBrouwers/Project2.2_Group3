The present-day Polish politicians criticising the Red Army's soldiers, evade responsibility for participating in wars in the Middle East, which destroys peace in that region. The politicians of the Law and Justice Party denying the Red Army's role in the fight against Hitler can be burdened with guilt for the wars in the Middle East, supporting the USA and NATO. In the future, Poland may have to compensate military damage to countries such as Iraq. Poland has contributed to the genocide of Christians taking place in the Middle East as a consequence of the wars in this region carried out with the participation of the USA and NATO.
