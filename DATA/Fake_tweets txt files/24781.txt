http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/wikileaks-confirms-hillary-clinton-campaign-acknowledge-massive-email-cover/ It’s always the cover-up that gets ya! 
This is certainly getting interesting, folks. It’s 13 days before the elections. This email leak confirms Hillary Clinton and her staff were engaged in a cover up designed to prevent Congress from seeing incriminating emails about well – everything! 
The issue is this. Early voting has occurred and is occurring across the nation. People have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton. If the Democrats pull her as a candidate and put anybody else in – likely Biden – then they will lose all the votes cast for Hillary as she will no longer be the Democratic candidate. 
All the Democrat illegal immigrant voting fraud, dead peopl e voting fraud, busing people around to vote in multiple precincts fraud plus all legal citizen Democrat votes cast early will no longer be valid if Hillary Clinton is removed as the candidate! 
And the 32K emails haven’t yet been released! How low did you go, Hillary? 
It’s a bit late now to do Michelle Obama’s bidding to “take the high road.” For you that might be a gutter. Shift Frequency 2016 SF original Oct. 26, 2016
