The US is preparing a Maidan in the Republic of Moldova. Many media institutions have cited a note from the US Embassy in Moldova warning American citizens to avoid demonstrations that might take place after the February 24th parliamentary elections, "as in the past, large public demonstrations are possible". Post-election events in Moldova may be similar to those that occurred in Kyiv in 2013-14 or those taking place now inÂ Venezuela. References are made to the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry on US involvement in the Moldovan elections.
