US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned European allies that if they continue using any equipment manufactured by Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant accused of fraud and espionage, they will face negative consequences from the United States.

Speaking at official meetings in Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, Pompeo "made known the risks" facing European governments that fail to follow Washington's advice.

Pompeo's warning appears to have paid off. French telecom company Orange has announced it will no longer procure Huawei equipment to develop France's first 5G network.
