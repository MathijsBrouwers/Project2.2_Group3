Donald Trump, already laying the ground work for a “rigged election” challenge after he loses, filed a frivolous lawsuit in Nevada that sought to erase the votes of many residents of Clark County because they dared wait line past the time polls closed (as was their legal right) and got their vote in during early voting. 
The lawsuit, on its face, was insane. Trump was arguing that people who waited in the long lines to vote should have been sent home once the polls officially closed. This is contrary to the law, which says that as long as a person is in line at the time of closing, they are legally entitled to cast their ballot. This is done specifically to ensure crooked politicians couldn’t disenfranchise voters by intentionally making lines so long that the poll workers can’t possibly get to all of the people. 
As reporter Jon Ralston noted in disbelief as the court case unfolded: This lawsuit has even less merit than I thought. And that is saying something.
