The attention of the media and the public is clinging to illegal migration, while the Czech Republic is Islamized by legal Muslim migrants. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 migrants from Arab countries in the Czech Republic and thousands more of them come each year. Most Arab migrants, according to the Ministry of the Interior, come from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Everything is happening unnoticed because migrants receive visas from Czech embassies in Arab states.
