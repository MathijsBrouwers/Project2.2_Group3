[Ed. – Way to go, Asher! Way to go, Asher’s parents!] 
Asher Nash may only be 15-months old, but he’s got the face of an angel. 
His mother knew of her son’s potential, despite his disability, and wanted an opportunity for him to be represented in the modeling world. 
But Meagan Nash ran into some issues: A talent agency wouldn’t even send out Asher’s photos — they wouldn’t even give him a shot. Her story was picked up by a few local organizations, all fighting for Asher. 
“The second reason, which is very near and dear to my heart, is acceptance. Without truly accepting my son and others with special needs, there can be no inclusion for them in the future,” Meagan said. 
Soon, her story went viral, and the children’s line OshKosh B’gosh responded, offering little Asher a spot in their 2017 campaign. 
“I don’t want [OshKosh] to use him because of this fuss we are making on the Internet. I want them to use him because they value him and see how much he could contribute to their advertisement,” Nash said .
