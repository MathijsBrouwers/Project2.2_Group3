VIDEO : Neil Cavuto to Defeated Hillary Pundit, “You Look Sad and Depressed” VIDEO : Neil Cavuto to Defeated Hillary Pundit, “You Look Sad and Depressed” Videos By Amy Moreno November 5, 2016 
The Hillary supporters see the writing on the wall. 
It’s the end of the big game, and Trump has the ball and is running the clock out. 
While he surges in the polls, Hillary and her supporting cast of dropkicks, like Obama, are SCREAMING at the crowds of people in what looks to be unhinged desperation. 
Hillary sounds like Howard Dean, screeching as if her political life depends on it, and Obama is lecturing voters, chastising them for not “LISTENING WHEN HE SPEAKS.” 
It’s a clown show. 
Neil points some of this out to his Hillary supporting guest, who appears very, very sad.
