Could the Notre Dame fire in Paris be a terror-attack kept secret from the people? Could be, and the motive for this secrecy is obvious. EU elections take place in few weeks' time. If just before the election the public would be informed that for example Muslims have burned one of the most remarkable buildings in Europe, this would have an impact on the outcome of the elections. This is a big motive to keep the real cause of the fire a secret.
