It is perfectly obvious that the missile defence bases [in Romania and Poland] are purposefully placed on the Western borders of the Russian Federation and target no country other than Russia.

The defence base in Romania has MK-41-start bases, which can pretty easily be used for the launch of heavy cruise missiles of the Tomahawk-class. These are cruise missiles with a medium range-reach which immediately breach the INF-Treaty from the year 1987.
