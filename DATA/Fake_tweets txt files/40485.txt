Any citizen of Russia may end up in this list [of Russian billionaires and top officials]. These demands were presented to all of us, to the whole nation. Every one of us is bad only because he/she lives in Russia, is Russian. It is something similar to racial segregation. Almost Nazism. There is an analogy from the last century. In Germany they said: a Jew is an enemy of the German nation only because he is a Jew. And they started the Holocaust.
