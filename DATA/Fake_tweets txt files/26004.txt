The publication announced the death of the beloved director by posting a photo and tribute to their Twitter account. The message was signed “JA” indicating that it came directly from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange; however, it is currently unknown at this time how Assange gained internet access as he recently had his access cut by the Ecuadorian Embassy over potential election “interference” charges. 
WikiLeaks also posted a statement from MacFadyen’s wife, Susan Benn, to the social media account.
