The USA gives the Ukrainian capital a “new name”.

The United States Board on Geographic Names has decided to make orthographic changes to the word ‘Kiev’. The American authorities unanimously decided to modify the name of the Ukrainian capital. Now, among other things, ‘Kyiv’ is to be written at airports and international organisations instead of ‘Kiev’.
