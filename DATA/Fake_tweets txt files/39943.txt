The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will sue several local town halls because that money offered to equip the libraries with computers in the frame of “Novateca” project has disappeared. According to reliable sources of the Independent.md portal, this was the decision of the review team, located in Moldova. They verified how the project, financed by the tycoon Bill Gates, was implemented.

Sources say that the district of Comrat recorded the biggest losses: only some computers out of more than one thousand sent from the US were received there.
