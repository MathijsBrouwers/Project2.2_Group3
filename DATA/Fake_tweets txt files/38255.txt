The US has an interest in destabilising Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, inhabited by ethnic Chechens. The US might provoke tensions in the Gorge and under the pretext of countering terrorism, it will build military bases in Georgia near the Russian border. The US special forces entered Georgia before under anti-terrorism motive and never left. Thus, the US seeks for any ground to have a military presence in Georgia.
