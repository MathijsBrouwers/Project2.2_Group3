In a further blow to the BBC, the hippos swimming in a circle who appear before the BBC news today confirmed they had signed a deal with the National Geographic channel. 
“I know some will see this as a betrayal,” said Edna, spokeshippo for the group. “But you have to realise, the career of a performing hippo isn’t long, and we have to think of our futures.” 
It’s thought their new role will focus less on synchronised swimming and more on traditional hippo behaviours, such as wallowing in mud and gaping angrily at each other in disputes over mating rights and territory. 
“It’s all a bit vulgar, really,” Edna continued. “We’re the best of friends in real life. But it’s what the public want, so what can you do?” 
Meanwhile Rex, spokesdog for the sheepdogs who run round a circular slalom course before the news, shifted uneasily when asked if he could ever be tempted away from the BBC by people offering him biscuits or telling him he was a good boy. 
“Look, it’s not up to us, is it? The shepherds whistle and point, we just go where we’re told,” he added, before running off after a squirrel. YaBasta
