NATO does not deserve the Czech Republic's 2% [of the GDP]. Czech defence spending should not serve the expansionary pan-world efforts of the United States, as has unfortunately been the case so far. It would be extremely sad if Czech taxpayers' money should be used to further liquidate sovereign nation states, to promote the interests of multinational corporations, and last but not least, to initiate wars over natural resources.
