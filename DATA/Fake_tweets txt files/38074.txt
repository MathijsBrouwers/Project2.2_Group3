American methods are clearly behind the protests against the construction of church in Yekaterinburg. It is a "strange coincidence" that the largest US consulate in the Russian Federation is in Yekaterinburg. And it is exactly in this city where Western programmes are the most active in the universities.

The rhetoric of the protesters is an exact copy from Ukrainian Maidan, and "revolutions" in other countries.

[...]Â  Without the US assistance the protests would fade away on their own if the state authorities did not attempt to start an unnecessary dialogue.
