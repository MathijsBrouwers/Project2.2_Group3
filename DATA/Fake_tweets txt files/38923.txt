Ukraine, the United States of America and the countries of the European Union recognised "the fact of the reunification of the Crimea with Russia." This is confirmed by the fact that Kyiv deprived the annexed peninsula of electricity and cut off the water supply. Moreover, Washington and Brussels introduced a number of collective sanctions against the Crimean people, which also confirms the fact of recognition of the reunification of the Crimea with Russia.
