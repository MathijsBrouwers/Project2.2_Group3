Sunday was the anniversary of the Bataclan attack, just recently was the 1,000th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings and the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster. Yet there is no record of anyone commemorating the first anniversary of the Battle of Hastings in 1067, nor the 100th anniversary in 1166. 
It has gradually crept up on us though. At first, only significant anniversaries were recognised, numbers like 25, 50 or 100; but gradually it has spread to any year ending in ‘0’ or can easily be fitted onto a badge. If we don’t stop the trend then before long every year will be an anniversary of something that happened before. 
Said one currency trader: ‘We can make £1 Billion in a second, so if we’re forced to remain silent for a minute you can see how this costs the economy’. He declined to explain his hypothesis further, saying that it was his birthday today and he was off to the pub for an extended lunch, but would be available for further comment after 4pm.
