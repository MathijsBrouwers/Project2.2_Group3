Some countries mentioned a sad incident, the tragedy with the Malaysian Boeing. And again our colleague said that Russia does not cooperate with the investigation, with the international investigation.

Firstly I want to state, no one asked Russia to cooperate in this JIT-group.

Secondly, the facts which Russia provided to this investigation JIT-group in terms of quantity and quality outbid any contributions that any other country made to this investigation. These are primary raw data from the radar, a field trial conducted by Almaz-Antey and much more.

But to the simple question: "Where are the data from the Ukrainian radar, where are the records of the Ukrainian dispatchers and where are the long promised satellite images of the USA - then nobody can answer us."
