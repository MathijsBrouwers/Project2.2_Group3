The recent resignation of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Ihar Shunevich, became a real celebration for the Belarusian opposition. Shunevich was an opponent of gays, lesbians, and transvestites, and an advocate of family values. He irritated Belarusian patriots and became a personal opponent for Belarusian human rights defender [Valiancin Stefanovich] who was advocating for gay traditions of those countries where such traditions have turned into madness.

He also negatively reacted to waiving LGBT flag by UK embassy on 17 May and must have found himself blacklisted by the UK ambassador to Belarus Fiona Gibb.

Despite Shunevich's resignation, Belarusian opposition may continue the hunt against him and attempts to prosecute Shunevich. The UK embassy, and personally Fiona Gibb, may finance a harassment campaign by the Belarusian opposition. Hence Shunevich must be given immunity from prosecution as this will guarantee the integrity of our family values.
