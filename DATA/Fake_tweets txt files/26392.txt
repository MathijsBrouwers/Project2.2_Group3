THE election of Donald Trump was inevitable and obvious, according to some smug, smart-arsed twat. 
The twat, Martin Bishop, used words including ‘disenfranchised’, ‘swamped’ and ‘angry’ to bolster an argument which was later described as ‘obvious’ and ‘rubbish’. 
Bishop said: “White working class, ignored, globalisation, elite.”
