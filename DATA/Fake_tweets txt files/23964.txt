Look in the dictionary under the term “hypocrisy” and there has to be a picture of Elizabeth Warren. Her latest beaut is sending a letter to Trump criticizing his transition team’s ties to Wall Street. 
Yet, how come Obama never received the same type of letter from her? Obama’s entire cabinet from 2008 to now is riddled with Wall Streeters. By the way, Lizzie, when the AG and former AG have law practices built around keeping Wall Street out of jail, that is a “tie to Wall Street.” I guess it’s a matter of convenience to overlook the fact that both Treasury Secretaries are and were deeply tied to Wall Street. 
Oh. Wait. I almost forgot. What about your beloved Hillary? No Wall Street ties there? You certainly forgot to chat about this when you were campaigning for her. Let me review the facts starting with the fact that Wall Street firms were among her largest campaign financiers. The biggest donor was perhaps the biggest Wall Street criminal: George Soros. Speaking of which, is this guy ever going to die and leave us alone? 
“Do as say, not as I do” seems to be de rigeur for the people and entities who thought Hillary’s presidency was a matter of formality. These people forgot that some segment of the public still pays some attention to the truth. 
Make no mistake, I’m not issuing support for Trump. But someone needs to hold people like Miss Warren accountable. God knows her zombie, slavish supporters won’t. I remain firm in my convictions that: the good news is, Hillary lost – the bad news is, Trump won. Share this:
