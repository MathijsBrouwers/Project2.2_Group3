These parliamentary elections were the last in Ukraine. There will be no elections in 2024. There will be no country called Ukraine. The events in the Middle East will make everyone forget what Ukraine is. We are talking about the WW3. Russia will be forced to let the refugees through to Ukraine, Europe and Turkey will do the same. The refugees will flood Ukraine, and it is going to be the end of the country.
