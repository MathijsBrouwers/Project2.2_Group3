BREAKING : Clinton Refuses to Answer Questions Regarding the Reopening of her Email Investigation BREAKING : Clinton Refuses to Answer Questions Regarding the Reopening of her Email Investigation Videos By Amy Moreno October 28, 2016 
The FBI has reopened Hillary’s email investigation after discovering “thousands of new emails” on Anthony Weiner’s phone. 
As the news broke, Hillary was touching down in IOWA for another small, lackluster rally. 
She was delayed getting off the plane. 
We’re told that her campaign was broadsided by the information. 
When Hillary finally emerged, she plastered that fake POLITICIAN SMILE on her plastic face and waved to the reporters, who shouted questions at her. 
Hillary did not respond to reporters.
