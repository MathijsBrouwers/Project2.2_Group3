The dismantling of USSR Marshal Zhukov bust in Kharkiv is a test for president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Those behind the toppling of the monument want to find out how Zelenskyy will react to this provocation. If Zelensky does not react, it will mean the continuation of post-Maidan Ukraine's policies in cultural, ideological and other fields which are being managed by radical nationalists. They serve as transmission belts for NATO provocations and its aggressive and isolating policies towards Russia.
