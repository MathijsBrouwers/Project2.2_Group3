The West interfered in Ukraine in 2014, leading to a Nazi coup d’état in the country.

For all these years the German government has been claiming ‘The West did not interfere in Ukraine in 2014’; ‘Right-wing extremists there had no influence’ and ‘The fall of President Yanukovych was not a coup d’état’. But these claims are false.

While the German government claimed in 2015 that foreign powers had played no role in the change of power in Ukraine in 2014, this was not only untrue but obscured the fact that Germany itself was very much involved in the preparation and implementation of the coup in Kyiv through its Embassy and cooperation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the media, and German politics, as well as with Vitali Klitschko. And even after the forced change of Government, Germany still cooperated with right-wing radical groups against anti-Maidan groups.
