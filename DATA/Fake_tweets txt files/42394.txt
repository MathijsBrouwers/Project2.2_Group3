The new joint command for special operation forces of Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia comes at a time when NATO continues to increase military presence in Europe, especially the eastern countries.

Moscow has denied these accusation several times, asserting that NATO forces deployment near Russian borders is a provocation.
