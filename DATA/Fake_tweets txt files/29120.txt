Report Copyright Violation Calling All Ohio Voters ... Diebolt I called the election board this morning, in Summit County. I talked to a man who assured me that basically no voter fraud is going to happen there.However he mentioned that to the west and south of me might be at risk, as they use the Diebolt voting machines.Anyone in Ohio please call your election board and ask about voter fraud.I think we need boots on the ground where Diebolt voting machine are being used.
