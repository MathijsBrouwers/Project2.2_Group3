The only election observers who would not turn a blind eye to election violations in Ukraine are Russian observers. Poroshenko's victory would be beneficial for other countries interested in Ukraine. Therefore, Russia should not recognise the election results in Ukraine.

After the EU managed to negotiate an agreement over Nord Stream 2, Ukrainians were given a consolation prize. Ukraine was given permission to deny access to Russian election observers. Russia may thus question the legitimacy of the next Ukrainian president.
