From the point of view of disinformation, the reintegration of the Donbas is impossible, because, firstly, the assets that the Donetsk clan had in Kyiv, they were plundered in their pockets. From the point of view of Ukraine, assets in Donetsk itself are no longer interesting. They (Ukraine) donâ€™t need coal. They do not need an industry that is half destroyed. In general, Ukraine does not need Donbas.
