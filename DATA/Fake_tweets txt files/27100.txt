Joseph P Anthony – It’s presidential week in the United States, and although the job of being president has proven to be incredibly stressful, two candidates vying for this position are willing to take on this responsibility. 
On Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th, Mars is on schedule to leave Capricorn and enter Aquarius. This sign’s switch for Mars is an unmistakable signal that whoever is elected will move things in a new (and, given the nature of Aquarius, possibly surprising) direction. 
On Wednesday we should know whether the first female is elected or someone who is not a politician will break the glass ceiling, or simply that something unusual and surprising could be in store. 
On Friday, to November 11th, it’s time for Venus to rein in the wilder side of its nature in Sagittarius and buckle down as it enters practical Capricorn, focusing her attention on realistic aspirations regarding love and money for the next month. On Saturday, November 12th, Mercury emerges out of the depths of Scorpio and begins to bask in the Sagittarian worldview of cheerful and optimistic communication. 
This sign likes to focus it energy on the future of sports, travel, religion, politics, education, and philosophy. Mercury paints with a very large brush in Sagittarius, so for the next three weeks, be on the lookout for embellishments and exaggerations (the fish was this big), especially from the newly elected president.
