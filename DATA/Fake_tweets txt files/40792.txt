Despite the fact that Moscow is constantly demonstrating readiness for partnership, NATO continues to see an enemy in the Russian Federation. Russia has refused to give up its sovereignty (as the West has demanded) for the benefit of peace. The West therefore rejects any Russian attempts for dialogue. The West is constantly scaring Europeans by the Russian invasion, which is unrealistic and fictional. The aim is to install fear in people, justifying the increase in the personnel capacities and in the "Western military apparatus" budget.
