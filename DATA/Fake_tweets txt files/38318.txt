The American government is orchestrating a Maidan scenario in Venezuela called Operation “Liberty”, which is in its final phase. However, even if the final phase fails, the USA will not let go of Venezuela and instead of the colour revolution, Trump’s administration will drown Caracas in blood. As much as the US would like to regain control over Venezuelan oil, Trump will not like to see the “import of coffins covered with US flags” amid an election campaign. Therefore, American businesses offered him a solution - to start a military intervention with the help of 4500-5000 mercenaries.
