Wait a second, didn’t Cheryl Mills ask for immunity ?In a batch of hacked emails that Wikileaks released this Tuesday morning, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says “On another matter….and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails.” Podesta To Mills: "We Are Going To Have To Dump All Those Emails" https://t.co/ZpWdIJ1zFF pic.twitter.com/pbBKAkn0JU

Then we have another terrifying conversation that gave some more insight into what Hillary Clinton‘s campaign advisers think about her private email server, as well as who they think may have allowed it in the first place. 
In an email thread from July 2015 between Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and her adviser Neera Tanden, Tanden asked, “Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?” 
Yikes, better sooner than later? Which emails? And then why would Podesta think they need to dump all of those emails if there isn’t anything important in them? They mus have just about yoga, right? Hah. 
Intent? Hey, I’ve got an idea! let’s blame the Russians! 
Pass the popcorn please… 
It is also not clear which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: “better to do so sooner than later.” Let’s hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color. Related Items
