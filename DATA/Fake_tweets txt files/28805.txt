Donald Trump took about two hours after a grueling cross-country campaign schedule to announce the opening of a new, beautiful hotel in the nation’s capital. 
The man has been moving non-stop for months, while Hillary puts on one lame rally, then takes a nap for what seems like days . 
So it was absolutely amazing when CNN reporter Dana Bash made the accusation that Trump was merely trying to get “free advertising” for his new hotel and neglecting his duties on the campaign trail. 
Do they ask these questions of Hillary Clinton? Of course they don’t. Here’s the video: Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: “No, not at all” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r

“So to people who say you’re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?” Bash asked. 
“I say the following: You have been covering me for the last — long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight,” Trump responded. 
“For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
Did the media ask Hillary where she was when she went off the grid for six days with only one event last month? Nope. 
Did they make any comments when she took the entire first half of August off to recuperate from exhaustion/pneumonia/dehydration or whatever they’re making up? Of course not. 
“Her speeches are so short – they don’t last long, they’re like 10 minutes and ‘let’s get out of here,’” Donald Trump said about her schedule. “Go back home and go to sleep.”
