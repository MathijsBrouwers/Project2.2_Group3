The refusal of Poland to allow Soviet troops to pass through its territory in 1939 was a mistake by the Polish authorities. The USSR could not wait until the German troops appeared on the Soviet borders and started a war against the Soviet Union from the surroundings of Minsk. Thus, if Poland realised a rational policy (based on its national interests), it would have been treated differently by the Soviet Union.
