This is the news everyone has been waiting. A Super Computer in India, which correctly predicted our ENTIRE Primary season, was just used to predict the results of the US Presidential election. 
The computer took into account more than 20 Million data points across the US, factoring in things most groups ignore like interaction of Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and came up with this as it’s final result… DONALD TRUMP WILL DEFINITELY WIN THE US ELECTION!! 
The Program, known as MoglA, was developed back in 2004 by an Indian developer named Sanjiv Rai. It has since been collecting Data and learning from every US election cycle, and has predicted every single trend since then. 
The news gets even better, though! As if it were not enough already that Trump is predicted to win, …He has also beat Barack Obama’s peak engagement figures from back in 2008 by 25 Percent!!! 
Now that is something the Lamestream media does NOT want you to know about. 
So I say Nate Silver and all the other Hillary shill pollsters can suck it! The Super Computer has spoken, and the winner is Donald Trump. 
Now it’s up to us to get this shared out all across Facebook so the world sees that the Revolution is REAL!
