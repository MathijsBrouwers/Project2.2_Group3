Citizens of the Republic of Moldova will be stripped of their Romanian passports. According to a new Romanian law, all the documents will have to be changed in order to correspond to a new grammatical revision. The letter "î" will be replaced in most of the cases (e.g. geographical names) with the letter "â". The Moldovan citizens with Romanian passports will have to change their documents.
