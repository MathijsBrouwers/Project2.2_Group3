If Hillary wants to know what new information the FBI has, Sharyl Attkisson knows someone she could ask Posted at 4:34 pm on October 29, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
As Twitchy reported, Hillary Clinton held a brief press conference Friday to address news that the FBI had found — in the process of investigating Anthony Weiner’s alleged sexting of a 15-year-old girl — new emails that warranted further investigation into her own email scandal. 
Obviously not pleased by this latest development, Clinton called on the FBI to release whatever it had. Hillary Clinton: "We don't know the facts, which is why we're calling on the FBI to release all the information it has … let’s get it out."

Despite that not being how FBI investigations work, Hillary’s call for the FBI to lay its cards on the table inspired Sharyl Attkisson of Full Measure News to make a simple suggestion: There's no mystery as to what's in the Huma Abedin emails–to Huma. She can fill in the Hillary campaign.

What didn’t Hillary think of that? Abedin is right there with her on board her campaign plane — it’s not like she’s hard to track down. Unless, of course, neither one can recall what they wrote to each other. It happens. More than 1,000 potentially relevant emails found on Weiner computer, including some between Huma and HRC. https://t.co/hVHL61vqrk
