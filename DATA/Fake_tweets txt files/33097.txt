Football Manager 2017 to include dicking about on Football Manager 2016 03-11-16 
THE new Football Manager allows players to spend downtime fiddling about on a slightly older football management simulator. 
Football Manager 2017, released yesterday, enables players to run a club’s first team, reserves, and youth team then waste time between matches with a game of Football Manager 2016. 
Wayne Hayes said: “I can take a break from trying to win the Premier League with Huddersfield Town and just mess around trying to get MK Dons promoted on Football Manager 2016 instead. 
“Though my manager on that is struggling to win the FA Cup with Hull on Football Manager 2015 , and in that game the manager’s trying to win Serie A with Torino on Football Manager 2014 , and it goes all the way down. 
“34 levels deep, there’s a manager taking a break from his day job with Everton in Football Manager 2 on the Amiga by enjoying a cup run with Norwich on Kevin Toms’s Football Manager for the ZX Spectrum. 
“I don’t know which one I am. I’m lost. I don’t know which way reality is any more.”
