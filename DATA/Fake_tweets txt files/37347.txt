WADA's decision to exclude Russia from major sports events is anti-Russian hysteria. The exclusion of the country from all major sporting events in the next four years is part of a campaign directed against Russia. Although it cannot be denied that Russia has serious problems with doping, it is still not justified to punish Russian athletes in this way. There is reason to believe that such decisions are not about the cleanliness of world sport, but about political considerations.
