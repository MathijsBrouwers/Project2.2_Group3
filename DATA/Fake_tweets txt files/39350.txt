The Western World and America are using the Church in hybrid warfare against Russia. Orthodox unity is something that the post-Soviet countries have in common. It is the last spiritual pillar of the nations since the Soviet times. That is why Istanbul gave Ukraine the kind of autocephaly that traps it within its own borders. Because nationalists are the main force against the powerful Soviet internationalism that the Americans and later Europeans copied with their European Union.

Now the attempts are made to disrupt the renaissance of unity through nostalgia for USSR. The issue of the church is not the project of President Poroshenko, but itâ€™s conducted on a higher level. After he loses the election Poroshenko will leave to Spain with his billions.
