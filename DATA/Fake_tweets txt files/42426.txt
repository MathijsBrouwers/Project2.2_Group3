Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia have set up a joint command for special operation forces and it's interesting that this news came in just as Russian systems S-400 and Pantsir S were being transported to Serbia to participate in military exercise "Slavic Brotherhood 2019".

The timing of the announcement of the joint command formed between four countries, two of which have borders with Serbia, shows the psychological need of NATO to posture and demonstrate that it's doing something after Russian tanks were brought to Serbia.
