Hillary Clinton is keeping her foot on the gas pedal by hammering Donald Trump for taking the day off to promote his hotel built with undocumented workers instead of campaigning.

Clinton said: 
Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trumpâ€™s hypocrisies. 
While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8. 
As Trump pimps his new hotel, Hillary Clinton is pushing even harder to win the White House.
