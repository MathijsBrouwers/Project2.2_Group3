Western support in certain issues is key, for example in the non-recognition policy. However, the West points out that Georgia should not have any more expectations. It is not allowed to supply Georgia with lethal weapons. Although they recognise that Georgia is an occupied country and that Georgia needs weapons to defend itself from the occupiers, they still do not supply Georgia with weapons â€“ they even do not sell them, not to mention giving them for free.
