Alfred Kinseyâ€™s 1948 report on sexuality was designed to promote the most deviant sexual behaviour. The report gave birth to the sexual revolution, which upset and overturned all values. Kinsey himself was a homosexual maniac who raped dozens of children. The sexual revolution that was born of this theory will upset and overthrow all Western values. In January 2018, UNESCO published its recommendations on sexual education in which it places great emphasis on the right to enjoy the pleasures of flesh.
