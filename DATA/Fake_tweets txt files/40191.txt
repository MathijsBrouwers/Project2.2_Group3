The problem is that the investigation was concluded before it ever started. All of the Western mainstream media outlets were suggesting from the beginning that Russia and Putin personally were behind this. So Iâ€™m not surprised about the timing, since the World Football Cup will start in weeks from now, and I think that, as it was the case with Sochi, a lot of bad PR and Russophobic propaganda will appear.
