In 2014, Ukraine was rocked by mass rallies and experienced a coup d'Ã©tat in Kiev which forced president Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country.

In the wake of this, Crimea rejoined Russia following a March referendum on the peninsula, with 96 percent voting for reunification, while Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence and refused to obey the new government in Kyiv.
