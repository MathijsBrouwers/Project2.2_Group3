Hillary Clinton spent a whole afternoon drunk and unresponsive while her campaign staff tried to reach her, a new WikiLeaks email reveals. 
An Aug. 8, 2015, email exchange with the subject “ Have you sent her the docs? ” between campaign chairman John Podesta and top aide Jennifer Palmieri revealed the two discussing whether to call Hillary and “ sober her up some .” 
John Podesta also suggested Hillary’s judgement might be impaired considering her drunken state. 
“ Should I call her and talk this through or better leave with you? ” Podesta asked at 2 p.m. 
“ I’m worried she’ll get on with Cheryl [Mills] and we’ll end up in a bad place. ” 
Two hours later Palmieri decided it was time drunk Hillary was roused from her unresponsive state. 
“ I think you should call her and sober her up some, ” she said. Is Hillary Clinton’s judgement impaired due to her daytime consumption of alcohol?
