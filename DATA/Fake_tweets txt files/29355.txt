Scientists Redefine Hurricanes and Deny Mini Ice Age will Effect Earth by IWB · October 27, 2016 Tweet 
With no hurricanes making landfall in 11 years in the USA, that takes us back to a 1860 record of longest without a hurricane. Since the scary predictions of more and more powerful hurricanes didnt work out for the global warming crowd, now they want to re-define what hurricanes are to make it appear that they are more destructive to fit the narrative of CO2 causes more hurricanes. Also the same crew says that the new Mini Ice Age will have no effect on Earth. What if they are wrong??
