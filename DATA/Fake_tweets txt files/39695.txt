Crimea is ours… And why ours? Not because we came and grabbed something… What is democracy? A government of the people. And how is a government of the people validated? Through referendums, elections and so on. People in Crimea turned out for a referendum and voted… to be independent and, as a next step,… to be a part of the Russian Federation.
