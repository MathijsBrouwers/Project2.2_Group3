Americans are interested in the Belarusian state only insofar as they are interested in Ukraine, as anti-Russian projects. UK's Chatham House is of similar view, as it wants to bring Alexander Lukashenko down after the period of "soft Belarusification". Events in Venezuela show that West can actually recognize any Belarusian opposition leader as interim president event before actual coup-d'Ã©tat.

The West plans to develop its expert and agent community in Belarus, to bring anti-Russian Ukrainian analytical centers and NGOs to Belarus, and to rely on Belarusian civil society in order to disrupt Russia-Belarus relations.
