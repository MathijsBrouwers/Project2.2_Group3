The Montreal Canadiens edged past the New York Islanders 3-2 on Wednesday night. 
Montreal took a 2-1 lead early in the third period on a goal by Phillip Danault. But it didnâ€™t take long for Dennis Seidenberg level things up for the Islanders. 
However, with just less than three minutes to play, Shea Weber scored his 3rd of the season on a power play to give Montreal the 3-2 victory.
