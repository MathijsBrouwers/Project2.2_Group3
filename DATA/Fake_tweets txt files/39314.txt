Americans framed former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss Kahn - who was a favourite for the upcoming presidential election in France in 2011. He was a critic of US economic policy, harmful for France as well. As president of France, he might have been inconvenient for the Americans. It was a political assassination of a man, who had all chances of becoming the President of France. Therefore in 2012 Fran√ßois Hollande, who was considered useful for the Americans, was put into the presidential chair in France.
