By 2050, the European Union will become Islamic. Some people in Europe are already replacing the star on the Christmas tree with a crescent moon [Islamic iconographic symbol].

The green banner of the Prophet will unite the European Union much more strongly than bureaucrats in Brussels. With migrants continuing to arrive in Europe, the balance is shifting even more towards Islamization. According to the most moderate forecasts, Europe will change completely and irrevocably by 2050.

The day will come when Russia will need to defend its western borders more than its southern borders from penetration by radical Islamists.
