American and French forces, and forces supported by Washington are doing excavations at archaeological sites around the city of Manbij. Allegedly, this is "how they are stealing archaeological findings and objects made of precious metals." The US and French, for example, have taken a lot of gold from these sites.

Manbij is used by the West to smuggle the artifacts out of Syria, to Turkey.

The artifact theft is not new to the US, as they assisted the looters of the Iraqi National Museum in 2003.
