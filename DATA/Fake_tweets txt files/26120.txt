UKIP calls for ban on gay fencing 04-11-16 
UKIP has called for the abolition of gay fencing. 
The party said that gay fencing was undermining British democracy and defying the will of the people. 
Nigel Farage, this week’s UKIP leader, said: “The decent, ordinary people of Britain are being imprisoned inside a massive gay fence. 
“We must tear down this fence, or at least paint it red white and blue, rather than this multi-coloured monstrosity that looks like it was designed by a Brazilian transvestite named ‘Roberto’.” 
Farage added: “More than 17 million people voted for this country to be protected by a large fence, roughly the same height as a typical English rugby player and with the same red-blooded, male urges.” 
The campaign has been backed by the Daily Mail , the Daily Express , the Daily Telegraph and the Sun , who are all offering a free pork pie to readers who destroy any fence that looks gay.
