DAMASCUS, SYRIA (2:05 P.M.) – The Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) launched a large-scale offensive in the eastern countryside of the Homs Governorate on Thursday, targeting the Al-Mahr Gas Fields and key town of Jubb Al-Jarrah. 
Initially, the offensive got off to a good start for the terrorist forces, as they managed to shoot down a Russian attack chopper near the Al-Sha’er Mountains. 
Not long after shooting down the attack chopper, ISIS stormed both Jubb Al-Jarrah and the Al-Mahr Gas Fields, resulting in a heated battle with the Syrian Armed Forces that lasted for several hours on Thursday. 
The Syrian Army’s stiff defenses proved impregnable on Thursday after the Islamic State suffered heavy losses to both military personnel and equipment in eastern Homs. 
According to an Al-Masdar field correspondent in Damascus, the Syrian Armed Forces killed a total of 28 Islamic State terrorists at Al-Mahr and Jubb Al-Jarrah, forcing the aforementioned terrorist group to withdraw their assault before sundown on Thursday.
