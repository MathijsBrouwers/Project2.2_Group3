The European Union increases spending on events that will become an instrument of influence on the internal affairs of third-party countries.Â  In 2020, the EU intends to allocate about 1,500,000 euros to create a mechanism of influence on other states and to create a network of European agents in other countries. This will be a new tool for the colonisation of other states.
