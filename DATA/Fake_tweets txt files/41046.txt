G20 riots were paid for by the German government since far left extremists benefit from public subsidies. This financing comes through government programme "Aktiv gegen Rechtsextremismus, Gewalt und Menschenfeindlichkeitâ€œ, which officially seeks to prevent right-wing extremism. Public funds also pay for the "Eine Welt Haus" in Munich, which constitutes the "entire infrastructure for the left-radical scene in Munich".
