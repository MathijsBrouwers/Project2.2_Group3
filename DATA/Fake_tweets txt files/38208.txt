According to a survey, performed by the Gallup institute, 43 per cent of Americans have a positive view on Socialism. 44 per cent of the Americans born between 1980 and 1990 want to live under Socialism. This is because of a rapid decay of moral standards and economy. Of course the global elites are attempting to curb this development.Â  During the Presidential campaign of 2016, Hillary Clinton, representing the Globalist Elites, managed to use manipulation and violent acts to stop "Socialist" Bernie Sanders, who would have had real chances to compete against Donald Trump.
