If there’s one thing we ask of a president, it’s that they be inclusive of all, and President-elect Trump, in a very bizarre way, kinda sorta, did that three years ago in the most Trumpian way ever. 
While most people have Thanksgiving messages of hope and gratitude, Donald Trump wants everyone to know that he wants their day to be happy. Absolutely everyone. Even the “haters and losers.” 
Here’s Trump’s Thanksgiving Day message he tweeted out three years ago: 
“Happy Thanksgiving to all–even the haters and losers!” via Twitter 
Yes, that’s the future leader of the free world, everyone. A man who will have more power than, well, anyone. 
Trump took to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day in 2013 and wished everyone a “Happy Thanksgiving” even to the “haters and losers” and best yet, the tweet is still in his timeline . So, the future President of the United States seems pretty damn proud of calling those who don’t like him “haters and losers” because he still has it on the record in his Twitter feed. 
It will be interesting to see what he tweets this year. Will it be off the cuff, or well-vetted by his staff. I’m sure we’re all on pins and needles waiting. Or not.
