Ambassadors of the EU and the USA met with priests of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The clergy told the diplomats and law enforcers about attempts of seizure of churches and about actions of resentment against a recent Cross Procession for peace in Ukraine. The clergy are also concerned about planned legislation that could legalise raids on churches and temples.
