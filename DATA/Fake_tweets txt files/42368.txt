Moscow Rus' is torn apart between gathering the territories, isolationism, Western pressure, and an attempt to turn East. Ukrainian Rus' and Belarusian Rus' are turning into the frontier oscillating between different civilizations and even into the real war frontier as it happened in Donbas.

Lately the ideology of unified Russian people consisting of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians is losing its popularity. A new Russian identity should deal with this new reality about three Russian states and three Russian political nations. Controversies among them can only be overcome when they have a common goal, that is perceiving themselves as one civilisation. Ukraine is not lost as long as Belarus stays with Russia. In case Belarus is weakened and falls into the situation similar to present-time Ukraine, the Russian civilisation will be shaken and the existence of Russia itself will be put in question.
