The EU triggered conflict in Ukraine in 2014.

Billion-euro programmes, such as those of the "Eastern Partnership of the EU" (EaP) with six former Soviet republics (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), dictate the so-called European values, expand the sphere of influence and markets. Unwise association agreements and interference by the so-called European politicians in the internal affairs of states sometimes even trigger conflicts, as was the case in Ukraine after the coup d'Ã©tat in 2014 (and as is currently happening in Venezuela). Deepened free trade with Ukraine has so far had no desired effects: corruption, war, poverty. Do European values look like this?
