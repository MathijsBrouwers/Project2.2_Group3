A monument to the Soviet Soldier-Liberator has been demolished in Lithuania. This monument - a huge boulder on which the face of a Red Army soldierÂ was carved - was installed over 30 years ago. The local authorities decided to definitely dismantle it within the framework of a so-called decommunization policy.
