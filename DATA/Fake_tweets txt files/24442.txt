There have been many prophets and seers throughout the ages with both wonderful and terrible predictions.

Some of the greatest and most accurate prophecies we ever encountered comes from the words of french seer Michel de Nostredame, better known by his latin coverted name "Nostradamus".


During the 16th century, he looked into the future and saw many great calamities engulfing the world, the world wars and even Donald Trump rising to power as President of the United States of America.

Conspiracy theorists are going crazy about these predictions, one of these even speaks of the beginning of a great and terrible war ordered by the "false trumpet". It talks about Greece becoming a landmark for immigrants and refugees which has been a topic at the centre of Trump's candidacy . 

So what's gonna become of the world now? How big will the American Wall be?
