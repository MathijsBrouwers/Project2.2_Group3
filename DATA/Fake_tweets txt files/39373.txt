Tomos issued by the Archbishop of Constantinople Bartholomew is a provocation of the Orthodox realm. It is dirty politics that has no connection to canonical law, Christianity and faith. There is no shadow of a doubt that the incumbent Archbishop Bartholomew has a pro-American geopolitical orientation. His determination in this matter is in line with strict instructions from Washington. He had already promised autocephaly to Yushchenko, but then the instruction was not so strict.
