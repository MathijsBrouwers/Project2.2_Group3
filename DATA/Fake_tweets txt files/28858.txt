As part of efforts to halt the dissemination of inaccurate reporting and propaganda on social media, Facebook has now blocked all status updates by ‘fake’ happy families. Likewise in the interests of truth, all images of new possessions will now be accompanied by scans of the various debtor agency letters, credit card warnings and the inevitable divorce certificate. 
‘Identifying “the truth” is actually quite difficult in an algorithm-driven environment,’ explained CEO Mark Zuckerber. ‘But anyone could see that the shots of this happy couple on a beach in Marbella were entirely bogus, considering the discovery of her clandestine affair, and his ongoing problem drinking.’ 
Unfortunately Facebook is awash with liars – like holier-than-thou Animal Rights supporters who secretly scoff burgers. Or staged images of ‘angelic’ grandchildren – who off camera are referred to as ‘snotty little shits’ who talk through the soaps. The same with sunset views of shapely legs; they are just photo-shopped knees, which normally resemble a pair of bowling bowls ‘lost in a sausage factory’. 
Anticipating a serious loss of revenue from lack of usership, Zuckerberg has announced plans for ‘FuckOffBook’– catering to the new straight-talking age of Brexit and Trump. It will encourage ‘honest’ discourse between new users with faeces and middle finger emojis. ‘We will not rest in our commitment to ending the scourge of fake news. And that’s as sure as Hillary Clinton ordered 9/11, and President Elect Trump won the popular vote.’ Dr Turmoil & SJ Roe (team effort!) Share this story...
