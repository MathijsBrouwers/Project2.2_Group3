The U.S. Government is most willing to utilize “religion” for the propagation of its agenda. It is not at all anti-religious, it is, although, completely anti-christian [sic]. A new global mind and narrative must emerge. For this to happen the “old” mind must be eradicated – Christianity, specifically Orthodoxy.

So it is not surprising at all when tremors begin to emerge that Joe Biden and others in the US government are at current [sic] putting pressure on the Patriarch of Jerusalem to recognize the false and schismatic group in Ukraine. The schismatic group in Ukraine is but one example of the current global power’s willingness to utilize “religion/church” as a tool for its goals.
