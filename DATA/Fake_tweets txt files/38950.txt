What happened in Salisbury on March 4, 2018? A year later, the British have not yet provided a clear explanation. But the answer to the question "why is all this necessary?" is now obvious.

This is part of the "dead cat" strategy, explained by former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. When someone is being defeated in an argument, the best thing to do is to "throw a dead cat on the table" said Johnson. This produces a clear effect: it attracts attention and makes everyone screamÂ  - distracting from the real problems.
