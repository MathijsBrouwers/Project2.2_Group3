No proof for the allegations made by the World Anti-Doping Agency's committee was presented to the public so far. There are many theories why Russian sport continues to be 'bullied'. Foremost, Russia is a strong sporting country, this is why others are scared of it and this is why the suspension of Russian athletes is beneficial to them. Russian representatives sit in many international sport federations and many dislike this too. The severity of penalties for guilty countries is different. No calls to suspend Norwegian or Americans for the doping scandals in winter sport and athletics were made. At the same time, the Russian doping scandal has become mainstream in the international sport community. Another version says that the whole doping story is revenge, organised by upset Englishmen for Russia's winning the bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
