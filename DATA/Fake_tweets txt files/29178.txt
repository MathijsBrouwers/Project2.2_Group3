What makes this extra special is that the CMAs are celebrating their 50th anniversary. 
Despite the award show being so close to the 2016 presidential election, Underwood recently expressed that she doesn't want to talk about politics as one of the night's hosts. 
The singer tells The Boot she wants the 50th anniversary of the CMAS to stay focused on what they're there to celebrate— the music: 
“I prefer to stay away from politics. This is country music, and we have 50 years to cover. So I feel like we’ll have lots to talk about, but I think it will be more geared to just us and what we do and all these legends that we have and people that have incredible talent that we have in our genre.” 
While we don't know if Paisley got Underwood's memo, we do know that he's already up to the duo's usual shenanigans . A few days ago, the singer encouraged everyone to vote for their favorite candidate. 
The singer made his choice clear with his shirt... A video posted by Brad Paisley (@bradpaisley) on Oct 21, 2016 at 1:56pm PDT 
Paisley's caption reads: 
“This November, be sure to vote for your favorite nominee... whoever that is...” 
The shirt is actually inspired by the Netflix series, “House of Cards.” The main character is named Frank Underwood, which also works nicely for joking around with Carrie Underwood.
