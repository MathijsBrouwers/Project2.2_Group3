About 1.5 million refugees have returned to Syria since the start of the conflict in 2011 and, hence, allegations that the Syrian government is not providing necessary conditions for their return are politically biased. The West is not helping Syrian refugees to return home as it channels large sums of money, like 7 billion euros allocated at the Brussels conference on supporting Syrian refugees, to refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. By doing so the West is trying to keep as many refugees as possible in camps outside Syria in order to influence how they vote in elections.
