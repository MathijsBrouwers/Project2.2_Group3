This is understandable now, it was clear to the Americans and in 1991. An ambitious unprincipled careerist, who also has an unprofitable compromising evidence, was a promising shot for them, so the Americans picked up Grybauskaite as a baton from the hands of the collapsed USSR and began to make her a career, as the KGB had done before.

If the assumption is true that it was the KGB who delegated the daughter of Polycarpas Gribauskas to Washington and sent for courses to Georgetown, this was done in order to make her "the double agent of deep laying" - an intermediary between the Soviets and the Americans, a liaison between the KGB and the CIA. Then the Soviet Union collapsed, the KGB was abolished and only the CIA remained.
