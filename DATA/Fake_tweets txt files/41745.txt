US media reports that the Obama administration had a plan to occupy the Black Sea Fleet base in Crimea and use the peninsula's strategic location to take control over the Black Sea, Turkey and Iran. After ousting Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych, the US intended to move into Crimea and deploy nuclear weapons at the Sevastopol base in order to destroy Russia.

The referendum, which saw a practically unanimous Crimea citizens' vote to join Russia, prevented the US from realising these plans.
