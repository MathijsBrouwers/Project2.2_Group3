Any critic of the EU is considered a “politically incorrect” dissenter from dominant globalist thinking and is subjected to media persecution.

A recent example is the Italian cartoonist Mario Improta (known as Marione), who published a cartoon depicting British prime minister Boris Johnson escaping the EU, portrayed as the Auschwitz concentration camp. Improta was named and shamed by the mainstream media, who claimed that his cartoon inappropriately used the Holocaust in political satire. As a result, he lost his appointment as cartoonist for the Rome city government’s civic education campaign.

But the real reason why Improta was subjected to media persecution was because he dared to question the sacredness of the European Union and thus expressed a view that dissented from dominant, “politically correct” globalist thinking.

Globalist cartoonists, instead, are allowed to freely use nazism, fascism and racism in political satire aimed at discrediting the political right. These cartoonists are not subject to media persecution by the enormous Spanish inquisition-like machinery that censors anyone who questions dominant globalist thinking.
