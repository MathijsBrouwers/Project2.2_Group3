All elections are subject to Russian interference. The intelligence services of Estonia consider Russian intervention in the European elections very likely. It is a question of propaganda rather than manipulation. Like the Benalla case or the Yellow Vest movement where some have seen the shadow of the Kremlin, it is possible that once again, the so-called experts of the Russian threat will recognise that they were wrong and have to eat their hats.
