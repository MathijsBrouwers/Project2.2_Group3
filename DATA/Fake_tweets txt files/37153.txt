Human rights are quickly turning into a weapon that the US seeks to employ. According to a report, issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the US should make more efforts to protect human rights around the world and demonstrate leadership in this matter amid the strengthening of authoritarianism. It is likely that at least some of these recommendations would be followed through, namely the ones focused on Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. The ones focused on Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel, those can wait.

Of course, examples of Russia and China’s misadventures in supporting “authoritarianism” are presented. For Russia – participation in the Syrian conflict and assisting the legitimate government led by President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow is also accused of allegedly striking civilian targets. Moscow has repeatedly denied such allegations. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the Russian air forces take all the necessary precautions so as not to cause damage to civilian objects and civilians.

The ones who are mostly disregarding human rights and international law is, in fact, the US.
