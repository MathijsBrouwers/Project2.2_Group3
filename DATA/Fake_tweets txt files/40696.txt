US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for the first time, directly and openly called modern Ukraine "the American project".

According to Pompeo, the weapons that the United States supplied to Ukraine were intended for the “war with Russia”. Ukraine is an anti-Russian project of the CIA, whereby Ukraine has been assigned the role of weakening, and possibly destructing, Russia.
