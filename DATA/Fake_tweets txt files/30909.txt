[11/1/16] As the clown sighting epidemic became more prevalent over recent months in America, so did searches for clown pornography. 
Pornhub, one of the go-to X-rated websites, released data showing a huge uptick in clown searches on their salacious website, including a 213-percent increase at its highest point. 
“Clown fetish porn has been around for some time, so searches on Pornhub are not uncommon,” the sites’ official blog post from mid-October reads. But in “the last 30 days there have been over 100,000 clown related searches.” 
Company statisticians also found that women are 33 percent more likely to search for clown porn than men. 
Popular search terms related to the costumed entertainers were “clown porn,” “clown girl,” “clown gangbang,” “clown orgy,” “midget clown,” “crazy clown,” “killer clown,” “lesbian clown,” “clown fart,” and “clown feet.” Post navigation
