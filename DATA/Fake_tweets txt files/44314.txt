Today the borderlines of good family relations blur. However, they have always been preserved by the church. Nowadays we are told: there is no mother, no farther, but only parent one and parent two. They promote homosexual and lesbian values. It is so scary, it is a real enmity against God. Afterwards they stay in the condition of moral decline. It is frightening to watch those who live in such a dissolute and licentious way.
