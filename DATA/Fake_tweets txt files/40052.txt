All levels of Czech politics are directed from Berlin. The German-Czech Future Fund (Deutsch-Tschechischer Zukunftsfonds) is a case in point, providing grants and funding to NGOs for programs supporting multiculturalism and inclusion. German NGOs, in cooperation with certain German schools, send representatives to the Czech Republic in order to indoctrinate Czech children through workshops and seminars - making them think positively about cohabiting with other ethnicities, especially the Arabs.
