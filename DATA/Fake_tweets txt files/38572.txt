More than half of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the Donbas who left the combat zone in 2014 still cannot find work on the territory controlled by the government of Ukraine. The reason for this is the low level of wages and the catastrophic shortage of jobs for Ukrainians. In addition, internally displaced persons cannot find housing, and therefore return to the occupied territories.
