Moldova accepted the first refugees from Bangladesh, whom Italy refused.Â Although their asylum status has not yet been determined, Chisinau is preparing to receive guests, developing a special mechanism for such cases. Despite the quota set for accepting migrants, Italy, which is a member of the European Union, has not yet accepted any. Will the flow of migrants be redirected from Italy to Moldova, which is not even a member of the EU and does not even have the necessary resources for it?.
