After its failure to overthrow Assad in Syria, the US has shifted its focus toward Venezuela, a country that Washington is now trying to destabilise under the pretext of “restoring democracy”. In reality, the US, which is an “agent of the New World Order”, is seeking to gain control over Venezuela’s oil resources by creating a crisis in the country followed by US military intervention.

The US destabilisation of Venezuela and its efforts to topple Maduro follow a familiar pattern of US interventions in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine, also justified as necessary for “promoting democracy”.
