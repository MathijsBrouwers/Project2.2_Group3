The European leaders, specifically Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Jean-Claude Juncker and the PMs of Luxembourg, Scotland, The Netherlands and Sweden, don't have children because they don't care about world's future. These people don't have an inner need for the future of the world, but only in their power over it. They don't feel to have a home, therefore they gave Europe to migrants.
