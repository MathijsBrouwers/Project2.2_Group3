Nazi Germany did not emerge on its own. There was an external support behind its creation, with the aim to confront the USSR and Soviet society. Nazi Germany was a collective West attacking the USSR. Oddly enough, at present Poland is siding with those who attempted to conquer the USSR. For instance, Poland raises the issue of the monuments of Soviet soldiers. It is a Western tradition to destroy the whole history, because, according to Joseph Goebbels, people without history become a tool at the hands of Western propaganda.
