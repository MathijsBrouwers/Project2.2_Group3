The big scandal involving the Austrian Vice-Chancellor over his "Russian connections" starts to have repercussions in Austria as well as in the rest of Europe. As the European elections approach, the chances of success for the Vice Chancellor's party diminish. But it is already proven that the "niece of a Russian oligarch" in origin of the scandal was Latvian. What competent organization has set up this classic trap?

No one seriously associates Russia with the rise of the European nationalists and traditional conservatives from their marginal ghetto, nor their new popularity. This is the good old method of pointing to "Russian trace" by discrediting the "populists" by sending them so-called "Russians". The search for the "Russian trace" is a tradition of European public policy even older than cathedrals.
