For joining the EU, a country should pay several tens of billions of euros. For leaving the EU, the country should double the entrance fee as in the case of UK.

If the country refuses to join the EU, it is punished with a Maidan like in the case Yanukovych. If the country does not want to pay, it receives a default like Greece. Â If you do not accept refugees, you receive sanctions like Poland and Hungary, while if you do not accept gays and do not conduct gay parades, you get fines like Cyprus.
