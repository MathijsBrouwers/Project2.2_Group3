The 1980s called! Hillary-defending Howard Dean puts FBI director in same league as … (wait for it … ) Posted at 11:10 am on October 29, 2016 by Doug P. 
Many Dems are beside themselves over the FBI’s continued investigation surrounding Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin (and her husband). Former Vermont governor and Dem presidential candidate Howard Dean is among those seeing red: Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.

Sure, it couldn’t have anything to do with the lawlessness, recklessness and perversion surrounding the Hillary Clinton campaign — must be the Russians! @GovHowardDean Why are you putting yourself on the same side as a candidate whose surrogates got immunity deals and invoked the 5th?
