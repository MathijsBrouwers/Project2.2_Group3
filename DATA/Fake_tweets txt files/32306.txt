We all knew that the voting machines are rigged! Here is the video proof. 
Trump was right. Where is the New York Times? Where is the Washington Post? Where are our esteemed reporters? There are citizens doing your job. 
Like this citizen below, y’all. The on in the video, y’all. Here is an alleged video of an election machine switching votes in the swing state of Virginia. EXPOSED! Election machines in the swing state of Virginia are switching Republican votes to Democrats pic.twitter.com/x8EXH7VpaE

Watch that video above. That is a computer programmer in Florida that testified before a congressional panel that there are computer programs that can secretly fix elections. This happened in 2001, but you would have never seen this on the mainstream media. 
*** Share this everywhere! 
Document everything at the polls. We need to be able to fight the rigging. God bless all the Trump voters and share this post if you are voting Trump on Nov. 8th. 
Together we can make America great again.
