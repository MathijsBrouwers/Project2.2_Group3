NATO continues to cultivate old ways of thinking and the image of Russia as an enemy.

One of the main objectives of the Western military alliance is still the "fight against the aggression of Moscow".

Moscow keeps calling for an end to Cold War block thinking.Â  But that would mean the alliance having to search for a new meaning and new goals. For NATO it is easier to live with the good old enemy image.
