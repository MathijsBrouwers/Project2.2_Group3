The story of what happened to an elderly woman who was reading her Bible while aboard an airline flight is being circulated online. It is unknown when or where the interaction between the woman and the Muslim man who was seated next to her transpired, but what happened when a flight attendant intervened subsequently went viral… 
This story may be apocryphal (widely circulated as being true while lacking authenticity), however, the fact that it has gone viral speaks to the fact that our culture is totally fed up with the progressive mentality that radical Islamic influence should be welcomed. 
SHARE this story if you think the flight attendant’s response in this situation was spot on!
