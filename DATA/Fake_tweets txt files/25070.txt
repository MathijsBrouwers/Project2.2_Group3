Maine Gets High Marks for Supporting   
By A.J. Higgins 
A New York personal finance technology company is giving Maine high marks for its efforts to encourage veterans to re-enter the work force and take advantage of veterans programs. 
Asees Singh, of SmartAssets, says that Maine ranks sixth in the country when it comes to several key programs. 
“When veterans come back from serving, the process to adjusting to civilian life can be really difficult for them,” Singh says. “A survey from Pew Research Center found that 27 percent of veterans had a difficult time re-acclimating to civilian life.” 
SmartAssets’ survey concluded that Maine should be proud of the fact that 10.5 percent of all private businesses in the state are owned by veterans.
