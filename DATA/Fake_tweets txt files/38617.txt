The Kurapaty memorial site on the outskirts of Minsk has become a Western project to ruin Belarusian statehood. Regular prayers by the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Kurapaty are a proof of this. The prayers are conducted for political reasons, to blame the Belarusian authorities for their incapacity, to provoke revolutionary moods among the population and to, eventually, destabilise the country.
