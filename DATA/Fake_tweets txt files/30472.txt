The man responsible for the 2014 nude photo leak that put dozens of Hollywood women’s most private moments on public display will spend a year and a half in prison. 
U.S. District Judge William W. Caldwell on Wednesday sentenced Ryan Collins, 36, to 18 months in federal prison, U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Brandler announced in a news release. 
Investigators have identified more than 600 victims. Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union and Kate Upton were among them, although the news release doesn’t mention them by name and, instead, references “female celebrities.” 
In March, Collins was charged with felony computer hacking and agreed to take a plea deal. Collins could have faced up to five years in federal prison, but prosecutors recommended 18 months and Caldwell agreed.
