Russia Did It: Cuck Moron Glenn Beck Claims The Alt-Right are Kremlin-Backed Terrorists 
Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 Glenn Beck is a mentally disturbed individual who belongs in an insane asylum to ensure the safety of the general public. 
The first time I saw Glenn Beck on my television set back in the mid 2000s, I could immediately tell what a rotten phony this fool was. I honestly don’t get how so many people got dragged into this idiot’s nonsense . 
He recently endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump which says everything you need to know about his character. He willfully supports the most corrupt political figure in American history over a man who has a track record of building and creating great things around the world. Under what logical scenario does that make any sense? One would only do that if they are insane or have ulterior motives. Especially considering how he has sold himself as a so-called “conservative” media personality for so many years. 
Now he is declaring a war on the Alt-Right . He has gone so far as to claim that the Alt-Right are Kremlin backed terrorists being armed by Vladimir Putin lol. 
He also suggests that people run away from anyone who uses the term “cuckservative” largely because he knows that he is theÂ very definition of that. 
This fool is insane. He should be put in a mental institution for the rest of his miserable life. There is no proof of anything that he is claiming.
