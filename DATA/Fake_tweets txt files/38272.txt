The West wants to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations by promoting Belarusian nationalism similar to the Ukrainian model. It is reported that the US and Poland have stopped financing all human rights organisations in Belarus in exchange for a nationalistic course set by Alyaksandr Lukashenka. The most important news opportunities for the promotion of nationalistic Belarusian sentiments in the Belarusian society are the anniversary of the Belarusian Popular Republic, the Kurapaty memorial site, the construction of Belarusian nuclear power plant, and discrediting the Russian Orthodox Church. Public protests are in a way the Belarusian opposition's form of reporting to the West.
