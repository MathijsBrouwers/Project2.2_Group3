The formation of the new Ukrainian cabinet was approved by US President adviser, John Bolton. Hence, it will not be allowed to develop closer relations with Russia. Ukraine's external governance remains in place. A whole floor at Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) building is occupied by Americans. The US State Department and US Embassy in Ukraine represent a system of "Gauleiters"; a super-structure, controlling the Ukrainian state. US gave instructions to former President Petro Poroshenko and Ukraine has not got rid of this.
However, the US does not need the project of "Ukraine as an Anti-Russia" anymore. The project is being decommissioned. Still it is premature to believe that Ukraine will soon get rid of external control. Ukraine's economic crisis was imported from the US. External actors extract Ukrainian human and financial resources to mitigate their own economic crises. How is it that Ukrainians believed that Russia was responsible for economic difficulties in 2014? Soviet people of slavonic origins, born in Little Russia.
