The history of the European Union shows that this organisation was never conceived in the interest of the European people, but against Russia. When the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Washington decided to transform the organisation in Brussels into a supra-national structure and introduce the nations of the Warsaw Pact, placing this anti-Russian « European Union » under the protection of NATO, and forbidding it any political role.The European Union has never fought for peace, but only for its Anglo-Saxon masters.
