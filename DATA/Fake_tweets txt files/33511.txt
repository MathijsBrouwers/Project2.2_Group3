Set the contents of Hillary’s emails aside for a moment. For this story let’s look at obstruction of justice.
You see, federal obstruction of justice in and of itself is a felony that carries a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Why is that relevant here? Well, Hillary Clinton and her inner circle told federal investigators all emails were turned over to the FBI. That would be fine and dandy if it were true.
But according to CBS it isn’t.
. @CBSNews confirms FBI found emails on #AnthonyWeiner computer, related to Hillary Clinton server, that are "new" & not previously reviewed.

CBS news confirms the FBI has emails from Weiner’s computer that had not been previously reviewed . 
In other words, those emails were never handed over to the FBI. This after Clinton and her team claimed all emails were handed over. 
What we have brewing here is both a lie and what appears to be blatant obstruction of justice.
