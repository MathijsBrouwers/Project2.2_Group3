In 2014, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko considered the option of giving up Crimea to Russia in return for membership in NATO and the European Union. The situation in Ukraine is similar to what happened to Georgia. It is already clear that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will not return to Georgia. However, the loss of Crimea can be used to acquire membership in the EU and NATO.
