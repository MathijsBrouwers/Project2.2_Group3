With the recent news that Affordable Healthcare rates are predicted to rise in 2017, you’d expect that any even partially informed Republican presidential candidate would jump on that news and spin it into oblivion. 
Not Trump, though. Nope. He was too busy plugging his new Florida resort to care. 
Seth Meyers spent Wednesday’s Late Night segment, A Closer Look , focusing on the abysmal way the Trump campaign is being managed and how it, as Seth put it, “never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.” 
While some of the segment was aimed at Trump spokesperson Newt Gingrich and his total meltdown on The Kelly File , Seth spent the better part of his time ripping Trump and his complete lack of knowledge about Obamacare to shreds. 
After showing video of Trump at his new Florida resort this week saying that all of his “employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare,” Seth had this question: 
“What are you talking about?! Obamacare is for people who don’t have health insurance, but your employees do get health insurance through you!!” 
We’ll see if Trump answers. 
Meanwhile, further proving his point, Meyers shows a clip of Trump’s resort manager clarifying to the media that 99 percent of their employees are indeed insured through the company and not Obamacare.
