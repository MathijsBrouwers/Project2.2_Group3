Tuesday 22 November 2016 Nazis sick and tired of being tarnished with same brush as ‘Alt-Right’ 
Nazis have hit out at press coverage which has led to many of their members being labelled as ‘Alt-right’. 
Nazi, Simon Williams, told us, “We have worked for many years to cultivate a certain image, so please stop tarnishing us with this name ‘Alt-Right’. 
“The Alt-right has significant negative connotations for us Nazis, not about the white supremacy thing, obviously, but you know, about being lonely boys, virgins, angry about the Ghostbuster remake – that sort of thing. We are not that. At all. 
“I am a Nazi and I’ve done with it loads of women, yes I have, and anyone who says different is lying.” 
Self-confessed Alt-Right member Tristan Matthews told us, “I’m not a Nazi, I just think white people are persecuted, women shouldn’t get paid the same as men, foreigners are evil and that I should be allowed to go around saying horrific things to anyone I like online – well, when my parents let me use the iPad, anyway. 
“If that makes me a Nazi, then so be it.” 
However, Williams added, “No it bloody doesn’t, stop making us look like twats!” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently
