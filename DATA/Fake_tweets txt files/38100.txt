All countries in the world can be divided into three groups. One is West, which attempts to impose its culture and values on the rest of the world. Countries in the second group try to resist the imposition of Western norms and to preserve their identity. Third group countries are not able to resist the pressure of Western culture and eventually undergo deformation and decay.

Ukraine definitely belongs to the third group of countries. It has lost most of its sovereignty, all spheres of the state and society have degraded, and the country have slid into civil war.
