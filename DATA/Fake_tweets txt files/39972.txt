The European Observers are completely passive and detached in relation to Georgia's provocative actions at the South Ossetian border.

The President of South Ossetia, Anatoly Bibilov, directly addressed the co-chairs of the Geneva discussions, representatives of the EU observersâ€™ mission in Georgia, and asked for decisive measures to be taken with Tbilisi to evade the real danger of a military conflict. However, there was no response. Georgia acts with the connivance of its Western partners.
