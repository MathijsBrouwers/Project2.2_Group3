The fight for the ‘liberal democracy’ seems to be on the rise in Moscow.

Russian investigators are looking for Sergei Fomin, one of the participants of the July 27 anti-government riot in Moscow, who left with an alleged stranger’s infant just to avoid a possible detention. The representative of the Moscow headquarters of the Investigative Committee, Yulia Ivanova, said that Sergei Fomin had dodged the investigators. She noted that, based on open information sources, Fomin, leaving the rally, picked up a stranger’s young child in his arms in order to freely pass the cordon.
