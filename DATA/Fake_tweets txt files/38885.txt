The OPCW report on the alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Douma  is full of gaps, discrepancies, and inconsistencies. 

The OPCW, which announced the use of chlorine in Douma in April 2018, did not take into account elements presented by Russia, Syria and even by British journalists, in particular the recent statement by the British journalist Riam Dalati.Â  After 6 months of investigation, according to this journalist, he could prove, without any doubt that the scene in the hospital of Douma was staged and no death occurred in the hospital.

The investigation conducted by OPCW was not transparent enough.
