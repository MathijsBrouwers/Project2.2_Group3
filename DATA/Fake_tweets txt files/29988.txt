Jury Rejects Federal Case Against Malheur Wildlife Refuge Defandants
http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/verdict-near-in-malheur-wildlife-refuge-standoff-trial/ 
From this account in the Voice of Idaho, it seems the Feds took out their loss on the defendants’ attorney:
“Ammon Bundy’s attorney Marcus Mumford sought the release of Ammon Bundy based upon the verdict of not guilty. The Federal Marshals refused to release him. Mumford insisted that they show the paperwork that allowed them to keep Ammon in custody. They wouldn’t show the paperwork. When Mumford refused to accept that as an answer, about eight federal marshals attacked Attorney Mumford IN THE COURT ROOM! They tasered him and arrested him!!”
During the trial the attorney was told by the judge that he could not mention the defendants’ spokesperson who was shot down by police for no reason. http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/judge-threatens-to-fine-ammon-bundys-lawyer-in-malheur-refuge-case/ 
The high-handedness of the Feds apparently was more than the jury could accept.
