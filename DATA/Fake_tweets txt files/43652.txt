A new report presented to the Security Council of Russia by the Internal Security Directorate of the Federal Security Service warns about US president Obama's plans with biological and chemical weapons. Last week, the USA signed contracts with 17 companies regarding logistics and service support for biological and chemical war projects. The report connects it with the prophecy of Baba Vanga who predicted Muslim invasion with the use of chemical weapons. Obama regime considers overpopulation to be a major problem and 
since we know, it was the USA who created ISIS, we can expect the usage of biochemical weapons in Europe.
