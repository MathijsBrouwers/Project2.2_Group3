The US destroyed the USSR through systematic indirect measures including blackmail, threats, mass protest actions and covert diplomacy. After the break-up of the USSR, the West's key concern became to preserve the post-Soviet space in a disintegrated form.

The Western capitals are very unhappy with the Union State between Belarus and Russia, which is the core of the reintegration process of the post-Soviet space.
The West, especially Washington and London, is extremely concerned about the creation of Great Russia (that is, the Russian Federation) and Belarus in the form of the Union State. It could become an example for the Little Russian (Ukrainian) people, tired of Russophobia and 'banderovshchina' [fascism,] and would put an end to the West's collective intentions to rule Northern Eurasia.

The main goal of the anti-Russian Western strategists of hybrid war in Ukraine and Belarus is to distort the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, to take away their Russian basis and replace it with Russophobia. Struck by the pathology of Russophobia, the Russian (Eastern) Slavs in Ukraine and Belarus slide into national betrayal and become Janissaries of the collective West. The West's goal is very clear: to destroy the Union state, to tear Belarus away from Russia and to turn Belarus into an anti-Russian buffer consisting of pro-Western semi-colonial states. They already include the Baltic countries, Ukraine, and Georgia.
