The "green madness" spanning the western world is already leading to serious economic repercussions.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg are against the so-called "patriarchal system of oppression" and urge to refrain from having children. They also declare that it is the locals' racism that makes migrants to commit crimes.

If Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg succeed in their environmental plans, the world will never be the same, and Russia and China are likely to remain the last islands of common sense. The flow of tourists from the European Union will go to Russia, because only in Russia (and in China, but we are closer) you can safely eat natural (rather than soy) meat and ride a gasoline car without being tormented by the conscience and the "ecological moral police" - the social network activists.
