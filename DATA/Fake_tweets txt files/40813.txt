We [in the USSR] got a computer sabotage by the United States of America. It was a gas leak in the gas pipeline, and two trains that drove into this cloud burned completely. Two passenger trains. And it was only in the late 90s that we learned from the memoirs of the CIA agents that it turned out to be a CIA mission. That they inserted computer bugs, which conducted the corresponding sabotage.
