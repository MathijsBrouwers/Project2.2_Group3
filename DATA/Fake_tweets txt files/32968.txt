Relieved Britain no longer biggest f**k-up of 2016 09-11-16 
BRITAIN has woken up relieved to find its idiotic act of self-harm earlier this year is now a piffling historical footnote. 
Across the UK, Britons are secretly delighted that when the great disasters of 2016 are remembered, Brexit will be completely overshadowed by America’s embrace of fascism. 
Mary Fisher, from Croydon, said: “Wow. Like obviously bad for them, but what a total save for us. 
“We’re the person who’s sick in the garden early on at the party, spends an hour thinking they’re an embarrassment, and then someone vomits explosively all over the leather couch and the new carpet. 
“Brexit’s nothing now. All we’ve done is get out of the EU before their decade-long war with Russia.” 
Historian Dr Helen Archer said: “For months we’ve been the world’s dumbest dickheads, and now we’re actually if anything a useful marker on the road to the total collapse of liberal democracy. 
“I mean end of the world, obviously, but every cloud.”
