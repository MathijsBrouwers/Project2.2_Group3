A homeless Black woman has taken to defending Donald Trump’s star on Hollywood Boulevard. 
It’s a lovely story. 
The Gateway Pundit : 
A homeless TRUMP SUPPORTER guarded Donald Trumpâs star on Hollywood Boulevard from violent Hillary supporters. 
The woman was holding a sign that reads, â20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep on the Streets in Tents. Vote Trump.â 
On Wednesday a violent leftist smashed Donald Trumpâs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
The culprits used a sledgehammer to destroy Donaldâs star. 
So later in the day this homeless person sat near the star to protect it. 
“Ima defend massa Trump’s star. Dat massa Trump, he a good man, Gawd bless em and Ima here defend he’s star.” 
You know, these Blacks did used to respect us. Love us, even. 
I’ve written a very important article about the love that Black slaves had for their slave masters, which you should read if you haven’t already. 
This story makes me think of that. 
But evil Hillary spics are now harassing this sweet Negress. They attacked her and destroyed her sign. 
It’s absolutely disgusting. 
It’s like what they’re doing to Danney Williams AKA D’Jamal Clinton. 
These people only care about the coloreds when they’re their little pets. 
Note: I’m not “going soft” on the Blacks. Hating Blacks collectively doesn’t mean that you can’t say something nice about an individual Black who is doing something nice. Read the slavery article. Yes, I still believe all Blacks – including this woman – should be deported to Africa. But I’m gonna personally make sure that when she gets to Africa, she is kangz n shit.
