Election rigging and dirty tricks against Trump and Brexit — Slattery and Collett 
Dr. Patrick Slattery and Mark Collett talk about the myriad of ways that the establishment tried to rig the outcome of both the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, how the British high court is now allowing for the government to overturn the will of the voters, and what the American (((establishment))) could block the inauguration of Donald Trump even if he is announced the winner of the November 8 election. Also, they discuss what still needs to be done to win back control over our societies.
