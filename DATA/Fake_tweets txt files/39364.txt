Forest brothers in Lithuania killed 25 thousand people during the WW2, including youth and children. Now they are awarded the Freedom Prize. It is symbolic that the freedom prize is awarded on the 13th of January. On this day in 1991 fifteen people died at the TV tower in Vilnius. Later independent experts determined that these people were killed by their own forces. The prize is 5000 euros - this is the price of Lithuanian freedom.

The freedom prize was made up by the parliament in 2011, is it given to those who are approved by the Lithuanian authorities for their public serviceÂ  - that is exceptionally russophobic.
