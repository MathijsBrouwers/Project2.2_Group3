The West is to blame for what's happening in Syria. However, the Syrian people have risen and are still fighting for their culture, independence and future, in spite of the fascist West and their Arab allies, treacherous NGOs, media etc. Russians came to rescue Syrian people and since then over one million of Syrians have returned home.
