The Ukrainian government is allegedly preparing an information attack on the occupied Crimea in order to disrupt the tourist season there. This is proven by a letter from the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of temporarily occupied territories Vadim Chernysh to the head of the Ministry of Information Policy Yuri Stetsyu. In it, Chernysh suggests to Stetsyu that the holiday season on the peninsula can be disrupted with the help of media and bloggers.
