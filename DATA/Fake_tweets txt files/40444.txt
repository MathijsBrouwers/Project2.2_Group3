Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has once again accused US billionaire George Soros of using his funds to buy influence in Brussels and the UN. The fears of Hungarian Prime Minister Orban are not groundless. We know very well that the Brussels’ establishment are implementing short-sighted policies that do not guarantee the European population. It seems that the European Union, the European Commission in the first place, is more oriented in guaranteeing the interests of the international elite, who are more interested in the lowering of labor costs and workers' contractual protections, glorifying the pathologies inherent in globalism.
