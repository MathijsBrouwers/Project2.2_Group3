Today the Baltic states are trying to erase the memory of the rich Soviet heritage. Soviet power built advanced plants, hydroelectric power stations, ports, and housing in the Baltic states. The well-being was taken for granted, but today it is mainly presented as proof of Soviet "occupation".

With the collapse of the Soviet Union the prosperity of the Baltic States ended. The handouts from Brussels turned the Baltic States into beggars and vassals of the West, with ruined economy, protracted financial crises and massive flight of people abroad.

Today the Baltic Russophobes are only capable of "containing Russia". The Baltic States turned Russophobia into their most demanded product in the West.
