Agreed. Our own politicians can't come up with enough ways to satisfy their true constituency---Wall St. and big banks, the MIC and weapons manufacturers, etc. What does it take for people to understand that they're not that into us----in fact, hardly at all.
Looking at Chapter 10 of the TPP, they've decided that a novel way to destroy us is to allow foreign corporations to bring their own workforce into the U.S., even if American workers qualify for the jobs, and to pay them below the minimum wage. This won't be hard to do since seven of the 11 other countries in the TPP, pay less than $3 an hour in wages. We'll be flooded now with legal immigrants. It's all about cheap labor and destabilizing other countries that won't go along with the program.
Who knows? Maybe they'll qualify for health subsidies on our exchanges. and we can pick up the tab for that, too.
