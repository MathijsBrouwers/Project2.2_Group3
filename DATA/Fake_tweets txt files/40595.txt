Poland and the United States have put considerable effort into promoting the idea that the Nord Stream 2 challenges EU security. For this purpose, the concept of “energy security” was established. Initially, this concept implied diversification of energy sources, but gradually, it has turned into a clear anti-Russian project. There has been a return to a “Cold War” approach, which assumed that it is not necessary to buy anything from Russia at all. This approach does not imply a diversification of energy sources (purchase of oil and gas from Russia and other suppliers), but on the contrary – to break contacts with Russia and search for other suppliers of energy sources.
