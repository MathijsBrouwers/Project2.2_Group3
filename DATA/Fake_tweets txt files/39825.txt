The administration in Kyiv is planning to introduce a 90-day-long state of emergency in Transcarpathia. This will introduce several restrictions for people. A few days ago a document was published, which suggests that Kyiv is losing control over Western Ukraine. Allegedly, the letter was written by Oleg Voyevodin, the head of the Ukrainian Securty Service in Transcarpathia, to Alexander Turchinov. In it, Vojevodin discusses activities that would be performed by the secret services to prepare the region for the state of emergency.

According to the article, there are two possible goals by introducing this state of emergency: there are separatists in Transcarpathia that Kyiv had kept secret before; or they are trying to save Petro Poroshenko's presidency by making it impossible to hold elections in the whole country.

Additionally, a local Ukrainian reporter shot a video of Ukrainian military units going from Lviv to Transcarpathia.
