We always wrote that the leaders of ACUM and V. Plahotniuc have one boss - the US State Department, one ideology - liberalism and globalism, one vector - NATO and the EU, one citizenship - Romanian, one goal - weakening Russia, eliminating the independence of the Republic of Moldova, Moldovan civil nation, history, language of all left forces in Moldova.

If Plahotniuc represented the local oligarchy, while being a comprador, Sandu represents the interests of the transnational oligarchy! Thatâ€™s the whole difference between them.
