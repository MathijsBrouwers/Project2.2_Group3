They say that the word 'dictatorship' for the French situation is too strong. Of course, if you compare it with the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, it will seem exaggerated. Still, there are 'dead' people too, because of capital, because of capitalism. Everything we eat, we ingest that causes cancer, all the people who kill one other, who are taking antibiotics and antidepressants, they are living dead. The destruction is almost invisible, but it is still there. Tyranny is invisible, but it is there.
