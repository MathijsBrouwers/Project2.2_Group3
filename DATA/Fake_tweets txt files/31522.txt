When Obamacare was voted in, it was by ALL Democrats, not one single Republican voted that garbage to existence. Now here we are with premiums skyrocketed, and set to increase EVEN more come 2017…to ridiculous heights. It’s all a huge mess…I mean… HUGE! 
Not everyone understands this, in the way they should. They only understand that they are losing money and the anxiety from it all is nearly throwing them into depression. I mean, we’re already working ourselves to the bone to live the “American Dream” that Obama has put so far out of reach in these last 8 years…do we really ALSO have to worry about being able to afford…staying ALIVE!? 
This is scary people! …and more should understand WHY it’s happening, so they can help do something about it. 
This video needs to go viral… 
Now I give you the new video…. “Broken Promises” 
Wasn’t that SPOT ON! 
Why does this need to spread everywhere? Because this is America, and we do not need to sit still and take this kind of abuse from the people making the choices in D.C. 
WE ARE THE PEOPLE! So we need to vote those asshats out of there, and get some people into the White House that actually love America and her people. 
It’s our country… squeeze the greed out of DC and exile it until forever. Related Items
