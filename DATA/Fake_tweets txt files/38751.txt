The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has decided to employ a plan to cancel the elections and advance his positions in Donbas. The spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Donetsk reports that they posses intelligence data confirming Ukraine planning to targeting an OSCE patrol with an explosive device, placed on the road. This way, Poroshenko would have a pretext to cancel the elections. OSCE would withdraw its personnel from Donbas and leave the field open for Ukraine's army.
