November 3, 2016 Mind-blowing Bible translating taking place 
A missionary is seeing first-hand how new technology is accelerating the trace of Bible translation like never before. 
Mark Thrash works with Wycliffe Associates traveling the world installing hi-tech computer equipment for national translators in an effort to greatly expedite the process. He says it used to take 20 to 40 years to translate the Bible in a heart language, but now it can be done in weeks. 
Thrash tells OneNewsNow about an experience with 121 church leaders in a Southeast Asian country. 
“They worked 8-12 hours a day for a month, and they got a solid draft of the entire Bible, Old and New Testament, done,” he details. “I don’t know about you, but that completely blows my mind.” 
And he believes that demonstrates how God’s Word is a treasure.
