The Czech Ministry of Interior is actively repressing people and websites with politically incorrect opinions. It is inspired by the NGO People in Need manual on fighting hate speech, which classifies basically any claim (e.g. "Part of the migrants are economic migrants") to be hate speech that should be punished by the state.
