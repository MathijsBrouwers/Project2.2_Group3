After the OPCW charged the Syrian regime with perpetrating the April 2018 chemical attack in Douma, a number of the watchdog's own investigators have questioned the official account of the tragedy.

The OPCW's conclusions ignore a minority report produced by its own members, which proves that the chemical agent cylinder found at the site of the alleged attack could not have been dropped from the air. Instead, it was placed there by somebody on the ground.

This instance of OPCW's suppressing and redacting its own findings undermines public trust in the organization.
