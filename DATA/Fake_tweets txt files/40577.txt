Maya Sandu's actions can be driven not only by her own ambitions. Someone might have simply given her a specific task, for example, provoke another domestic political crisis in the country, or maybe a coup in order to remove the socialists and the president of the republic from power. Itâ€™s not a secret for anyone who Maya Grigoryevna is, that she is the so-called protege of the West, and specifically the USA and, naturally, is supervised by the CIA.
