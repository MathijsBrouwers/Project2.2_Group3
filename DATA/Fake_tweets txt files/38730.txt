The elections in Ukraine are rigged. The IT Department of SBU, the State Security Service of Ukraine, is controlling the Ukrainian e-voting system, "Vybory". A few weeks before the election, the staff of the IT Dept suddenly gets a big pay rise. The SBU is totally under President Poroshenko's control, and all is done to secure his victory in the elections.
