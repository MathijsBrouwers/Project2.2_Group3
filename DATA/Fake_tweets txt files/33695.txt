Police and activists protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline are in a tense standoff over the activists’ occupation of and reportedly belonging to the pipeline developer.
So far more then 260 people have been arrested since the larger demonstrations began in August.
More than 125 of the water protectors were arrested over the weekend during multiple nonviolent direct actions aimed at halting construction of the 1,100-mile pipeline which is slated to run through four states.
Armored riot police attacked a march on Saturday with tear gas and arrested 83 people on charges ranging from assault on a peace officer to rioting and criminal trespass. Police also shot down two camera drones operated by Native American journalists.
Activists report that harassment, strip searches and beatings at the hands of North Dakota police are becoming commonplace, but the assembled tribes remain determined to block the pipeline, which they say threatens both sacred lands and the water supply for millions of people.
Our friend Derrick Broze for MintPress news reporting from the Standing Rock Reservation just tweeted out that Camps are being removed. Tasers out, pepper spray, guns, riot gear, batons, LRAD. Then after that he him self had been tazed in the conflict.
