Using his well-honed Barack-knows-best attitude, the president has overruled yet more federal judges, prosecutors and juries, commuting the prison sentences of 98 additional drug dealers. 
This brings to 872 the number of commutations the Democrat has granted, 688 of them this year alone, a record. More than 200 of these individuals were originally sent away for life by the nationâ€™s legal system. Many of their crimes involved firearms. 
The growing early-release figure for Obama, who has admitted his own past drug use, is already larger than the last 11 presidents combined , according to a boastful White House lawyer. And with 84 days remaining on his Oval Office lease, the Chicagoan claims he is far from done. 
Two years ago he vowed to release 10,000 felons before leaving office.
