Ukraine secretly cedes its borders to the European Union.

Ukraine's border service fully obeys FRONTEX. Ukrainian passengers at the Kyiv and Odesa airports are screened by EU border guards. European border guards donâ€™t trust their Ukrainian colleagues and have decided to check the quality of work in person. 

On the other hand, the invasion of a new wave of migrants from Ukraine is becoming a big problem in Europe. In order to prevent the subsequent collapse of the eurozone in a context of rising anti-immigrant sentiments, the European structures decided to stop potential criminals before they cross the border.
