Celebratory events devoted to the outbreak of World War II were held in Poland. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) decided to use this important date for a political demonstration and hold an informal summit of the leaders of Western democracies. The government of Poland decided not to invite the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and it resulted in a failure of their ‘genius’ plan: none of the leaders of Europe, the United States, China, Japan, other countries of Asia-Pacific, Belarus, Armenia, or other countries of the post-Soviet space attended the celebrations. However, presidents of Ukraine and Georgia did fly to Warsaw.
