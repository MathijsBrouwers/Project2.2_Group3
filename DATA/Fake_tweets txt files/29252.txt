Donald Trump has finally done it! Less than a week after his presidential nomination, Trump has kept his word on “Draining the Swamp” in Washington DC with a new ruling that has lobbyists p*ssing all over themselves!! 
In a historic move never before seen by a US President, Trump declared that ALL officials working with his campaign, on his transition team, and in his cabinet will be BANNED from working as DC lobbyists for 5 years to prevent them from abusing their connections for self-gain! Image From Gawker 
Not only that, but ANYONE who wants to work for Trump is now required to immediately end ALL of their current connections to lobbying groups or be FIRED instantly. 
But the Donald was not done yet. To put icing on the cake, he has also moved to officially have the term lobbyist apply to ALL DC insiders working as “consultants” or “advisors” when in reality, “we all know they are lobbyists.” Video by CNN – Trump Drain the Swamp!! 
Of course, you know all the long-time Senators and lobbying groups are already freaking out. Mitch McConnel refused to acknowledge the ban when pressured by reporters while the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics tried to intimidate Trump by saying “This will have a chilling effect on his hiring, no doubt.” 
Uh, yeah. Now Donald Trump will have to hire people NOT trying to line their pockets with hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars. Sounds like a real loss to me…NOT!! 
If you are proud of President Trump for standing up against the DC lobbyists and career politicians, let him know by sharing this out to every person you know!!
