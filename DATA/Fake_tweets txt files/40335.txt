All responsibility for the release of Nikulin is borne by Czech Justice Minister Robert Pelikan, who ruled on the release of Nikulin to the US. However, Pelikan violated human rights and international conventions, because he had made a decision on the release at the time when Evgeni Nikulin was still in the Czech Republic's asylum protection regime.
