Today, a series of important pieces of information emerged in a rapid sequence, crowned by a declaration by German Minister of Defense (Ursula von der Leyen) in which she is pushing government colleagues from the German Socialdemocrats to make an increase in defense spending.
The Minister thinks that Germany must be ready for an attack from Russia. She also recalled the old known saying that the best defense is in some cases an attack. Against Russia.
