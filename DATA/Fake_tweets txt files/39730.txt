Bellingcat did not investigate Skripal poisoning and, in fact, published leaks from British intelligence.

Bellingcat, just as in the case of the Malaysian "Boeing" shot down in Ukraine, presented as "results of its investigation" materials provided by Western intelligence services. However, there is no investigation of the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings, said Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.
