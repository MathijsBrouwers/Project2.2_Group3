The British have done everything to make Russia an enemy. What happened in Salisbury is a pure swindle and does not correspond to reality. All this is manipulated for the political purpose of aggravating relations with Russia to increase the weight of the United Kingdom.

None of the premises are sustainable. It is said that the Russians have deployed a chemical weapon of military level. Nobody is dead! What kind of military poison is it if nobody died? It's a total counter-truth. Then it is said that only the Russians had the means and the motive. Neither affirmation is true. It is not only the Russians who have a motive and the possibility and the means. Nothing in this story is sustainable.
