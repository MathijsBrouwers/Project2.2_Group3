The term "conspiracy theory" is itself part of a broader conspiracy against the truth. The term "conspiracy theory" was invented by a Jewish professor at the university of Vienna, Karl Popper, who is the creator of the open society theory. His best student George Soros, whose real name is Schwartz, is the enforcer of the conspiracy aiming to label all those who speak the truth as conspiracy theorists.
