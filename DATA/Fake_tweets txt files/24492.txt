Others mused what might be going on Melania’s mind: Trump forced to keep his eye on his wife while voting. #ElectionDay pic.twitter.com/drMcRo2pdV

Some couldn’t resist commenting on how the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as Eric Trump was also caught peeking at his wife’s ballot. Like father, like son pic.twitter.com/dqnoEZF4xf

Interestingly, this may not be the only common Election Day indiscretion the father and son have in common. Trump’s peeking violates the New York State law outlining the privacy of voters as pointed out by Alex Howard: When you vote on #ElectionDay , remember election laws require us to respect the privacy of others: https://t.co/dwXtM3avWB pic.twitter.com/0lXFaWGztU

Earlier, Eric Trump tweeted a picture of his own ballot today, which is also illegal . He subsequently deleted it. I’m sure Donald Sr. wishes the Peeping Trump photo of him could be deleted as well.
