After less than two seasons on “The View,” co-host Raven-Symoné has officially announced she is leaving the daytime talk show: A photo posted by Raven-Symoné (@ravensymone) on Oct 19, 2016 at 12:30pm PDT 
This may not come as a major surprise to viewers, since rumors of her departure have been swirling since last year—not to mention the fact that she only appeared on the show around once a week this past season. 
However, what the star has planned next might be more of a shock. 
According to reports, Symoné is leaving the show so that she can focus all her efforts on her next project: a spinoff of her childhood show, “That's So Raven.” 
For those unfamiliar with the show, it was about a high school girl who was able to see into the future: A video posted by Raven-Symoné (@ravensymone) on Sep 30, 2016 at 1:22pm PDT 
During an interview, the actress said of her departure: 
“I'm excited and sad, but mostly excited. I have an announcement to make: No, I'm not pregnant.” 
Symoné then broke the news about her Disney Channel follow-up series: 
"There's no title yet, but I'm calling it That's So Raven 2. It's Raven Baxter. It's still me. 
But I am a mother this time. I'm going to be a single mother raising two kids, and one of them learns that she has visions." A photo posted by Raven-Symoné (@ravensymone) on May 27, 2016 at 12:35pm PDT 
The host stated that her last day on “The View” will be this December. But an official date has yet to be determined. 
As for her departure from “The View,” she said: 
“I've had such a great time...I've learned so much, and I've been saying, my experience has been multidimensional.” A photo posted by Raven-Symoné (@ravensymone) on Jul 6, 2016 at 1:01pm PDT 
The 30-year-old will reportedly be moving from NYC to L.A. so that she can start filming the show. 
For those who have never seen the show, here is the opening of the original, which first aired in 2003: 
That's so Raven.
