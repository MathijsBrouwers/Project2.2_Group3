Negotiations in Beslan would have been futile. The terrorists never formulated their demands clearly, only mentioned the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and the independence of the region.

At 13h, 3rd of September 2004, an explosion was heard, and terrorists opened fire. The origin of the explosion remains obscure until today. It forced Spetsnaz to instantly make the decision to attack.

Among the terrorists were many Ingush trained in the separatist republic. There were also identified British nationals of Algerian origin, as well as funding from Saudi and Kuwaiti nationals, de facto internationalising the cell. In December 2006, the State Duma Commission noted that the terrorists were responsible for the initial explosion.
