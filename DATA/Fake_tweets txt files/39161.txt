Czech Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar, in an interview to the newspaper Právo, did not exclude the possibility of talks in NATO on the possible deployment of new military bases in Europe, also in the Czech Republic, in case of the deterioration of the international relations following the disintegration of the INF.

Previously, Czech Premier Andrej Babiš, commenting on the withdrawal of both the US and Russia from the INF, stated that he would not like to return to the cold war times.
