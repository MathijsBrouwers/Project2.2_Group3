Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate said that a surface-to-air missile launched from a Buk air defense system that downed the Malaysia Airline flight MH17 in 2014 was manufactured in Dolgoprudny outside Moscow in 1986 and sent to Ukraine, from where it has never returned to Russia. [Meaning the MH17 flight could not have been shot down by the BUK missile system that arrived from Russia just before the tragedy and returned to Russia right after the tragedy, as the JIT investigation shows.]

"The missile with the side number 886847379 designed for the Buk air defense missile system was transported by rail to military unit 20152 on December 29, 1986. The actual name of this military unit is the 223rd Air Defense Missile Brigade of the Carpathian Military District, stationed in the Ternopil region. After the Soviet Union's breakup, it was not transferred outside Ukraine", said Parshin.
