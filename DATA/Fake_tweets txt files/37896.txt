The Swedish government is investing 5 million Swedish krona (around half a million euro) to teach migrants how to have sex with Swedish women. The funding goes to a web site, devoted to "health, sex and equality". The material on the site can be read in Swedish, Arabic, Somali and Dari. The illustrations show dark-skinned men and blond women with European looks.
