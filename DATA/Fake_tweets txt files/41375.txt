Ukraine is now almost completely under Washington’s control thanks to the US meddling that was the cause for the Maidan and the war in Donbas. The “powers that be” in Kiev push a hardcore anti-Russian/pro-EU/pro-Western agenda, because they have to serve masters who got them into power. Presenting Ukraine as a sovereign nation that needs to be won over to America’s side is a complete lie.
