The United Kingdom is isolating the “inconvenient ones”: it is ok to lie when all the like-minded ones stand up and lie in chorus, without those who will tell the truth. It is easier not to let Russia Today and Sputnik in, so they don’t ask the wrong questions. The fashion for Russophobia is still very much alive. They are in a state of panic that someone will ask the wrong questions.
