I recently interviewed Oathkeepers Stewart Rhodes and one of his writers who goes by the handle of “Navy Jack” about their plans to oversee the elections for fairness and to remove the intimidation that is coming from the Soros/Clinton cabal.
This interview produced some of the best election analysis that is on the airwaves. Among the many points discussed centered around the possibility of Clinton being indicted after winning the election but before the the Inauguration. We would have an old-fashioned Constitutional crisis.
Listen to this fascinating interview and then please circulate this widely. Make it go viral!
