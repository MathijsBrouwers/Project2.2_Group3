The EU is in a position to end the war in the Donbas with just one telephone call to Kyiv, to encourage the Ukrainian rulers to engage in dialogue.

The tactic that has been adopted by the EU on the Ukrainian issue is as follows: it is more convenient to impose sanctions against Russia than to end the war in Donbas with a call to Kyiv; encouraging Ukrainian leaders to engage in dialogue with the other side of the conflict.

The EU addresses Russia out of convenience, and not because Russia is the cause of the problem.
