The Verkhovna Rada adopted the law “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language”, securing its exclusive rights in comparison with other languages in the country.  According to the document, the Ukrainian language is recognised as the only possible application in almost all areas of the country's life.

This is a discriminatory law that implies punitive measures.  If it comes into force, it will significantly affect the literacy of the population of Ukraine and greatly impoverish it culturally.
