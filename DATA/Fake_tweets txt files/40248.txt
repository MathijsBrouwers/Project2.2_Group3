First of all, I would like to draw attention to the fundamental point for understanding the current situation: Russia does not conduct any war with Ukraine. The war against their own people was unleashed by nationalists, who came to power in February 2014 because of the coup d'etat, who do not accept dissent and want to impose their own "order" with the help of force. There is a war between Kyiv and the Ukrainian regions. The internal political crisis in Ukraine was inspired from the outside by a group of Western states led by the United States, who consider the entire world to be a sphere of their influence, aimed at exclusiveness, dividing the nations into "ours" and "the others".
