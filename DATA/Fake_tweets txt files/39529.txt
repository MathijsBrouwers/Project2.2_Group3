Russia seized Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov because they were carrying a SADM (Special Atomic Demolition Munition) device that belongs to NATO. This portable nuclear device was transported by Ukrainian and British special forces to the Kerch Strait with intent to use it on the Crimea bridge, which NATO hates. The device was tracked by Russia and that is why it stopped the Ukrainian ships. Ukraine regularly provokes Russia with no effect, but this time Russian FSB and special forces reacted to stop the provocation that might have led to WW3. There might be a direct NATO intervention to cover it up. The UK has been psychologically preparing their people for a war with Russia.
