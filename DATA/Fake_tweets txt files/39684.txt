The UK extends the rights for its Special Forces to kill and torture throughout the world.

UK's Security Service MI5 is linked to high-profile murders of former KGB agents, attempted murders, as well as deaths of some persons associated with Russia, including Boris Berezovsky and Badri Patarkatsishvili.

It is beyond any doubt that Berezovsky was cooperating with British Special Forces. He was recruited by an agent named Pablo Miller - the same Pablo Miller, who also recruited Alexander Litvinenko - later he was killed in London - as well as recently poisoned Sergei Skripal. "So, the question arises â€“ why do the agents of British special forces become the victims of criminals exactly when it is so favourable for their employers?".
