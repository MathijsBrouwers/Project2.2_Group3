Dalia Grybauskaite, President of Lithuania addressing the UN General Assembly, lies when saying that "Despite a special responsibility that was imposed on the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council - the protection of international law - Russia violates the UN Charter. It attacked Georgiaâ€™. She lies because it was recognized by the EU commission that it was Georgia, who attacked, and that we just exceeded the necessary defence limits.

She lies that Russia illegally annexed the Crimea, because there was a referendum in Crimea, and she lies when saying that Russia is participating directly in the war in Easter Ukraine.
