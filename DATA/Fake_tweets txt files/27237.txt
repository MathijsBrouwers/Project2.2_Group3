A combat veteran with PTSD wasn’t allowed to fly with her service dog. So she sued.   30, 2016 PTSD 
By Peter Holley 
Lisa McCombs, a decorated Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, claims she’d never had any trouble flying with her service dog, a Labrador retriever named Jake. 
That changed one year ago, when she was barred from boarding a regional American Airlines flight with Jake, who was wearing his service vest and was properly documented at the time, according to a federal lawsuit. 
McCombs suffers from PTSD and relies on her dog to calm her anxiety and panic before it overwhelms her. 
But as she waited to board her return flight from Manhattan, Kansas, an airline agent approached her and asked “in a condescending tone, ‘ummm, are you going to fly with that ?’” the suit states.
