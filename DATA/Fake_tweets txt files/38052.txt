Acting President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, won the early presidential election in Kazakhstan, according to preliminary estimates. Observers have not recorded any serious violations that could hinder the voting process, which they recognise as democratic. The observer mission of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) did not record any ballot box stuffing during the vote. The elections were "credible and democratic".
