In an elaborate game of double-bluff respectable news outlets, with flour-based products in their name, have been forced to defend well-researched headlines like – Robert Mugabe declares himself the new Doctor Who and Ventnor man fails to acknowledge acknowledgement of traffic courtesy . Bizarrely some skeptical folk still question the facts behind – Universe in chaos as Pavlov’s dogs may or may not attack Schrödinger’s cat . 
The issues with ‘fake news’ spreading on social media have been solved according to Facebook: ‘We know everyone has been very concerned about fake news stories spreading, especially stories that exaggerate the number of murders committed by presidential candidates, but I can assure you we’ve fixed the problem now, don’t worry about it any more and move on with your lives. Please share this news with all your friends in case anyone tries to spread a story that it’s still a problem’. Bigglesworth
