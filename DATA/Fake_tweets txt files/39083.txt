US and EU politicians, who authorised strikes on Syria over false evidence, will try to avoid responsibility.

Over the past few years, the Russian Defence Ministry has repeatedly stressed that sooner or later, the truth about these fabrications of Western countries would make its way to the light. And many current high-level policymakers in the United States and Europe, who then called for the 'protection of peaceful Syrians from the regime's terrible chemical attacks' and authorised missile and air strikes on Syria, will try to 'forget' this issue to avoid moral, political and criminal responsibility.
