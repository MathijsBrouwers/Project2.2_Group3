What Does Trump Make of Russia in Crimea Criminal or Innocent Bystander? @paulr_gregory, @hooverinst. 
Russia’s hasty withdrawal from the ICC is explained by the fact that Russia’s carefully constructed Ukrainian narrative would not survive the ICC’s promised “detailed factual and legal analysis” that was to follow its preliminary findings.

The Russia narrative depicts Russia as a “bystander” to the events in Ukraine, looking askance as neo-Nazi extremists take over Kiev and threaten frightened Crimeans and East Ukrainians with genocide. The Russian narrative praises the pro-Russian people of Crimea for organizing their own annexation and the endangered East Ukrainians as the people’s republics organized armed volunteers to fight off the extremist rapists and crucifiers sent by the illegal Kiev junta. Russia, of course, could not prevent patriotic Russian fighters from volunteering for duty on the Ukrainian field of battle, some during their vacation leaves. Russian soldiers killed or captured in Ukraine had, after all, signed papers separating themselves from the Russian army. As an innocent bystander, Russia has earned a place as a peacemaker in the Minsk negotiations, but claims it has limited influence over the separatist forces. The Russian narrative claims that innocent bystander Russia wants a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine on its borders but with the peoples’ republics having a veto over Ukraine’s foreign policy. The narrative does not state that such an arrangement would spell the end of an independent Ukraine.
