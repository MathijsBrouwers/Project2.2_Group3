A US marine infiltrated the 'guarimberos' (a popular term for the participants on 'guarimbas' or barricades). He was leading the violent incidents on the Colombia-Venezuela border and teaching subversive techniques to the 'guarimberos' hired by opposition deputy José Manuel Olivares. This proves that the Venezuelan right, Colombian president Iván Duque and the US have plans to promote violence in the country.
