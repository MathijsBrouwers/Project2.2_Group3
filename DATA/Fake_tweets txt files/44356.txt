Crimea carried out a referendum in 2014 after clashes in the Ukrainian capital which resulted in a violent coup d'Ã©tat. The people of the peninsula voted to leave Ukraine and subsequently rejoined Russia. Later that spring, Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence and refused to obey the illegal interim government in Kyiv.
