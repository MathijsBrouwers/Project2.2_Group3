A host of TV Obiektivi, Valeri Kvaratskhelia, denied the occupation of Georgia by Russia: "When you are asked a question about occupation, why do not you answer straightly that there has been no such thing as occupation? There is not even a hint of occupation."

"If we recognize that Abkhazia and Ossetia are occupied by Russia, then the remaining part of Georgia is occupied by Americans. They are everywhere. They rule Georgia", said Kvaratskhelia.
