In 2017, the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was on its way to Syria accompanied by battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. During this trip, British warship HMS Richmond openly and impudently tried to take a place in the column of Russian aircraft carriers driven by its “banal curiosity.” Ultimately, the Russian warship crossed Richmond’s route, prompting the British warship to retreat. This is yet another example of “Battle of Russian and NATO Navies.”
