The New York Times has published a map of Ukraine on which Crimea is in the colours of Russia. While Kiev is unhappy, the publication of this map by the US newspaper clearly shows that everyone is tired of the rhetoric about the alleged "annexation" of the peninsula by Moscow. It is high time that Ukrainian politicians understood that it is impossible to always repeat the same old narrative on the "annexation of Crimea". This is the past of the old Ukrainian criminal regime. Crimea, annexed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, returned to Russia following a referendum in March 2014 following a coup in Kiev.

Kiev should adopt a more constructive approach, respect the choice of the inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula and restore peace in Donbas.
