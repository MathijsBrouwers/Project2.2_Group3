This is vintage M. Kelly. People have been calling for her ouster for over a year. Her coquettish pandering to the camera is absolutely nauseating. One cannot take her seriously. Mr. Gingrich crushed her. She was outmatched, outsmarted and never responded to his request. Thank God a station break saved her from further embarrassment. She's more fluff than fodder.
