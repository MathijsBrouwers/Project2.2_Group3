Can’t make this up: Michael Moore is pissed that his anti-Trump movie might help elect Donald Trump Posted at 7:38 am on October 27, 2016 by Greg P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
This is really one of the funnier things we’ve seen this election. 
Michael Moore has a new anti-Trump movie out called “TrumpLand,” but it’s a 4-minute clip of the movie where Moore makes the case for why Donald Trump will win that’s being shared right now by pro-Trump forces and that has the portly filmmaker all out of sorts. 
For example, Donald Jr. told all of his followers to watch it on Wednesday: Hey everyone – Trump, Jr. & right wing thinks my movie called "TrumpLand" is pro-Trump! Haha. Pls don't tell them otherwise! #satire #irony pic.twitter.com/difR93uzTg

Trump comms guy Jason Miller thinks it’s a “must-see”, too: Michael Moore must-see (not a typo) – disagree on many issues, but he speaks with conviction and clarity here: " https://t.co/Z1mU96doRZ "
