There is no big difference for the US regarding who will be Ukraine's next president because, in any case, American geopolitical interests in Ukraine are strongly protected for the near future. If Volodymyr Zelensky becomes the next President, pressure on the Russian language in Ukraine will likely soften, whereas the powers of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory over Ukrainian history and culture are likely be diminished.

On foreign policy, under Zelensky's presidency, Ukraine will continue Euro-Atlantic integration. The country's external debts to IMF and the World Bank will keep growing and relations with Russia will remain confrontational. As for the resolution of the Donbas conflict or Crimeaâ€™s status, these issues are decided in Washington rather than in Kyiv. The US is interested in unleashing anti-Russia hysteria in Central Europe and in containing Russia via an escalation in Russia-Ukraine relations.
