For two years US special prosecutor Robert Mueller investigated the alleged Russian intervention in the US presidential elections but did not find any evidence of collusion between US President Donald Trump and Moscow â€” which was denied both in the Kremlin and in the White House.

In his first public statement in all this time, Mueller stated that his office was closing, and he was retiring, as the investigation was completed, and stressed that he could not provide any other information besides what has already been made public.
