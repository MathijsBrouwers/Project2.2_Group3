The mystery of the crash of the Boeing 777 of Malaysia Airlines remains unsolved.

The international investigation led by the Netherlands continues and Russia denounces it as biased, accusing investigators of neglecting the evidence it provides. In autumn 2016, the Russian aeronautical authority, Rosaviatsia, provided radar data showing that no missiles had been launched from the rebel-held areas on the day of the crash. The Dutch said that the Russian radar was unable to locate a relatively small object the size of a missile. In response, Oleg Stortchevoy, head of Rosaviatsia, rejected this claim, adding that the radar station could detect objects much smaller than a BUK missile. In September 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defence held a press conference presenting documents demonstrating that the missile at the origin of the tragedy belonged to Ukraine and was produced in 1986. Russia claimed to have been able to reconstruct the history of the missile with serial number 8868720. It was produced in a factory in the Moscow region in 1986, before being delivered to a Ukrainian military unit, according to documents submitted by the Russian Defence.

Ukraine, which had decided not to close its airspace in a conflict region, escapes international condemnation.
