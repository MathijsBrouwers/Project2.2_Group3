The concept of Russkiy mir, The Russian World, is an all-Russian nationm consisting of Great Russians, Little Russians (Ukrainians), Belarusians and Rusyns. As a result of cultural and information warfare carried by Anglo-Saxons the number of Russian speakers decreased at 50 million people over the last 20 years. Moldova chose a Latin alphabet, Kazakhstan will soon follow the case, while in Belarus a Polish type of Latin alphabet is used in metro and at road signs.
