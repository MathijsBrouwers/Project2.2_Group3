Well, I would have to agree with the Clinton camp on this one, for what will probably be the first and last time ever. Her supporters are “f*cking dumb”… 
A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump reveals what the Clinton campaign really thinks of their millennial supporters. 
Marketing Executive Wendy Bronfein, who was introduced to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta in another email as someone who “could be immensely helpful in improving HRC’s connection to millennials,” advises on how to reach “f**king dumb” young people. 
According to infowars , Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton “may not be the best face” to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize “trending figures” as part of an “infusion to pull younger voters” because “that’s the crap that young people pay attention to.” 
She goes on to state, “It’s f**king dumb but being “cool” counts for more than it maybe should.” 
“I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they “follow”. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate,” writes Bronfein. 
Take a look… 
This is not the first time Clinton and her team have demeaned their own voter base. It was revealed in another email that Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being “stupid.” 
And in an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying that Bernie Sanders supporters are “living in their parents’ basement” and had bought into a “false promise.” 
In yet another email, Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing “an unaware and compliant citizenry.” 
Indeed, WikiLeaks has been the gift that keeps on giving.
