The MH17 was guided by the UA air traffic controllers above Donbas. The Ukrainians didn't provide their radar data, and the Russian ones don't contain any sign of a missile, however because of the limited reach of the radar, it should still be possible that the Boeing was shot down by UA fighter planes that might have been approaching from the west. The claims by the Dutch investigators on the fatal cause of the disaster being surface-to-air rocket is therefore false. The truth will never be known, and that's because the US and its puppet Ukraine are concealing crucial information. The allegations of Russian involvement in the disaster are made up only to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea.
