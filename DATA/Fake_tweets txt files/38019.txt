It is clear that the country is occupied by Soros and other transnational institutions. Moreover, everyday day, the occupation deepens. The Soros Foundation is a distributor of degradation, perversion and immorality in the country. It is destroying the traditional family institute, the state and making the country a sectarist. During the second and third Presidents of Armenia, Soros and other structures were creating spies and trying to lobby. Now, after the coup d'etat in 2018, they are an institutional component of the government.
The Soros Open Society Foundation has nothing to do with democracy and civil society. It has been proved, once again, that the Soros Foundation serves foreign interests in Armenia. Over the last 2 years, the entirety of its grants go to liquidating traditional values and building a network of agents.
