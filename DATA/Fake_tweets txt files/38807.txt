After the 2014 coup d'Ã©tat in Kyiv, new militaristic authorities posed direct threat to life and health of the Ukrainian citizens which pushed Crimean inhabitants to hold a referendum. The referendum was held in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution. Article 138 of Ukrainian Constitution directly gives the Autonomous Republic of Crimea the right to hold referendums. Furthermore, the principle of self-determination is endorsed in the Article 1 of the UN Charter. A big number of international acts and precedents prove that the population of Crimea had full moral and judicial right to pose the question and to make a decision.
