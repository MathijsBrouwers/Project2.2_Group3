[Boris Johnson] is doing everything to ensure that Britain exits the EU on hard conditions. Well done Johnson! He shows what a rotten union the European Union is. At a certain point, it worked in favour of all European states. Well, if not all, then at least for the main countries. But then they began to expand to Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and now they are dragging in the devil knows who.

Let them go out. Let them show that the European Union is an organisation that is not useful for everyone and that countries are leaving it. By the way, a useful example for Ukraine.
