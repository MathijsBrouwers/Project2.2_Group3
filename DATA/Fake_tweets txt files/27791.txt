In a truly shocking twist, the Supreme Court of Austria has decided to acquit the Iraqi man, “that may not have realised the 10-year-old Austrian boy did not want to be sexually abused by him.” Amir, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna in December 2015, as part of a trip to encourage integration, when the rape incident occurred.
Europe, if you can’t stand up for your children, who will? Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years. Is it a guilty conscience that seems to appease the blatant criminal activity on behalf of some newcomers? Or are they George Soros puppets implanted into the judicial system that are at work?
Russia is a multicultural and multi-religious society, and has been for 1000 years. The law applies to everyone equally – whether you’re a Crimean Tatar or a Slavic Russian – every Russian citizen is ‘native’ as such and subject to the same protocols.
A migrant has just raped a child in one of the European countries. The court found him “NOT GUILTY” based on two things: the migrant did not understand the language of his host country, and he did not understand that the boy – and it was a boy – didn’t want this.
Vladimir Putin was outraged when he heard about the incident and here’s what he had to say:
It doesn’t fit into my head what on Earth they’re thinking over there. This is the result of the dilution of national values [identity].
I can’t even explain the rationale – is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What’s going on? It’s not clear.
But a society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow. It has no future.
So relying on their [migration policy] experience is not the best thing to do, if I can be frank.
But we have a 1000 year history of forming a multicultural society – our understanding of [these intricacies] is much deeper.
