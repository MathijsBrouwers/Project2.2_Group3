Vilnius has started court proceedings against the soviet soldiers, who in 1991 were trying to disperse the crowds that were attacking the TV tower. The charges are trumped up.

The experts have determined that people died from sniper-fire and hunting rifles, but the soviet soldiers had no equipment like that. To this day it is not clear who fired the shots upon the protesting crowd. There was a third party involved. Lithuanians fired on their own people. It was the first example of a colour revolution.
