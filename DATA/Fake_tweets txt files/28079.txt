On Oct. 26, 2016, at 19:18:06.3 UTC, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake rattled throughout Central Italy. This occurred two hours after a quake with a magnitude of 5.5 caused severe damages. The epicenter was located at 42.97º N and 13.13º E. It reached a depth of 20 km.
Earlier, on October 26, at 17:10:36.3 UTC, a 5.5 magnitude temblor rumbled Central Italy. Its epicenter originating at coordinates 42:88º N and 13:13º E, with a depth of 9 km. Approximately 2,686,000 people were able to feel the thunderous rumbling.
Two hours after the 5.5 M earthquake destroyed several foundations to iconic buildings, in Central Italy, a relentless 6.1 magnitude temblor originated in the same proximity as the first one. Enduring two earthquakes, above a magnitude 5, increases the chances of significant damages, power outages, and possible flooding.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced that the injury reports, thus far, remain at zero. Several buildings have collapsed after a 6.1 magnitude earthquake occurred within two hours of a 5.5 M temblor rocked Central Italy.
Efforts to maintain the safety of the people is ongoing. Aftershocks are anticipated. Guardian Liberty Voice will provide any new information as it becomes available.
