On Sunday night, just days after the FBI officially re-opened their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton, someone played with Google’s search algorithm, according to The Political Insider . 
If you searched “pathological liar,” a picture of Hillary Clinton appeared next to the definition of the term. 
“It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders,” read the definition to the left of Clinton’s headshot. 
“Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.” 
Take a look… 
If you searched “45th US President,” something even better appeared: 
Google has since changed their search results to appease the left, but thankfully, these screenshots were taken just in time!
