Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says Saudi Arabia’s killing of Yemenis is "the worst type of terrorism." 
“Terrorism is not limited to terror acts committed by some unofficial groups, and mass killings of people by certain governments, such as the Saudi attack on people in a mourning procession in Yemen, which left hundreds killed and injured, are the worst type of terrorism,” the Leader said in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in Tehran on Wednesday. 
Ayatollah Khamenei also described terrorism as one of the “painful” sufferings gripping the human society, and called for a sincere fight against the scourge. 
“Countering terrorism needs the serious resolve of all those who have an influence within global powers,” the Leader said, calling on world pundits and governments to take measures to deal with the phenomenon.

Ayatollah Khamenei also said the US and certain Western countries are not sincere in the fight against terrorism. 
“These governments calculate all issues based on their own interests, and they do not think about eradicating the malady of terrorism in Iraq or Syria,” the Leader added. 
Ayatollah Khamenei further criticized UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s failure to condemn the Saudi war on Yemen. 
“The UN secretary general said explicitly that it is not possible for the body to condemn the killing of Yemeni children as the UN depends on the Saudi government’s money,” the Leader said, stressing that this approach is indicative of the “deplorable moral state” of politicians at the helm of international organizations.
