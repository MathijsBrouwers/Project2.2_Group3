US asked Israel to provoke the crash of the Russian jet IL-20 with the further aim to strike Russian military bases in Syria, said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of Political Studies, member of the Public Chamber of Russia.

"I think, they [the Israel Air Forces] were asked by Americans to do that (organize the crash of IL-20), I say honestly! Right next to our bases, our plane crashed. They are coming to our military facilities in Syria and are preparing, in fact, to strike at them!", said Markov.
