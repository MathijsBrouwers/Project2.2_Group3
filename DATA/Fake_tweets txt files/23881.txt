With the possibility that America may elect the first female president in history, there has been much speculation surrounding what we would call her husband. 
During the 2008 election, Todd Palin joked that he liked to be referred to as the “First Dude” when his wife was Governor of Alaska, and the term could be brought to the White House.

“What I hope I’ll be is the first volunteer,” the former president said. “I hope to be the best free labor she’s got.”
