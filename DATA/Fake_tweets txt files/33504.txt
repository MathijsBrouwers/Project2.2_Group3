— Marcus Norvell (@MrNorvell) October 27, 2016 @ Dakota Access #Pipeline : Stupid SJWs set tires on fire sending toxic fumes into the air. Oh ya, save the environment — more b.s. by Left. pic.twitter.com/yVx5MqAxkV 
— Raven*H⚓️U*Wolf (@RavenHUWolf) October 27, 2016 @NoDakTrav really makes sense to protest an oil pipeline and protecting the water/environment by setting fire to tires. SMH. 
— Nate Heinrich (@NateDH78) October 27, 2016 Hey #NoDAPL protestors. I appreciate you standing up for environment but you see the irony in setting rubber tires ablaze right? Burning tires at #NoDAPL Smh 
Smart guys. You just made yourselves look stupid.

Ruffalo missed out on the fumes, instead appearing on “The Lead with Jake Tapper” Thursday to point out the aggressive attitude emanating from police at the scene, compounded not only by their AR-15s but also — their black sunglasses. . @MarkRuffalo speaks about police being 'aggressive' at pipeline protests: "I met a girl who had her arm broken" https://t.co/kd0JKhQMug
