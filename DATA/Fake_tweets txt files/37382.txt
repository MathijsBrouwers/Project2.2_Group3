Not only Nazi collaborators but also respectable international institutions like the European Parliament continue to distort the history of World War II. The recent European Parliament resolution that equates Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union is an example of a blatant lie about World War II. The resolution almost accuses the Soviet Union of being responsible, along with Nazi Germany, for the outbreak of World War II, apparently forgetting that the Nazis invaded Poland on September 1st 1939 and attacked the Soviet Union on June 22nd 1941.

Those who question this brazen lie are even accused of conducting information warfare against Democratic Europe.
