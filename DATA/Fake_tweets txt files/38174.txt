An escalation of violence and a revolt of which we know nothing or almost nothing in the West. 13 thousand deaths that are unknown because the cause seems heard. Not recognized by the international community and because it is pro-Russian self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk would have no word to say.
Who is responsible for these wars? Who continues to pour oil on the fire? Who wants to oppose the European peoples? It's clearly Washington. Yugoslavia was destroyed because it did not correspond to the geopolitical strategy of Washington, the Atlantists, the neoconservatives, the hawks.. It's the same situation in Ukraine. Who financed, who paid the Maidan? Who paid Ukrainian extremists to make them physically, violently bring down the democratically elected president of Ukraine? Yanukovich was ousted by Washington because Washington does not want Ukraine to remain in the Russian world at all.
