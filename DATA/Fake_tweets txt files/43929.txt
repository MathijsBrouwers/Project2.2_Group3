Last Week's Trend: Global terrorism is controlled from the USA. And not only terrorism. The materialization of the word "evil" presents this list: JFK, FED, petro-dollar, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Korea, Vietnam, September 11, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Al Qaeda, ISIS, Monsanto, GMO, multicultural, LGBTI, TPP or perhaps now TTIP. Nothing is sacred for the creator of the evil - not even the death of people.
