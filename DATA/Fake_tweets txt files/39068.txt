Ukrainians are to be forced to celebrate Europe Day instead of Victory Day. The following project of bill was registered by Ukrainian deputies in Verkhovna Rada. This is part of the campaign to level down the Soviet holidays in Ukraine. Earlier,Â the director of the Institute of National Memory of Ukraine, Vladimir Vyatrovich, proposed a project to abolish Victory Day.

Attacks on holidays from the side of the Institute continue for the third year in a row: nationalists are trying to rewrite the Ukraine's history in accordance with new ideological guidelines. Victory Day and International Women's Day are particularly prominent targets of rejection.
