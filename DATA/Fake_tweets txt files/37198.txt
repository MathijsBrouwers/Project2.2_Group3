The Ukrainian Parliament presented its Draft National Budget for 2020. The almost two times increase of the country’s military budget was announced at a briefing by Minister of Finance Oksana Markarova. The increase in defense is clearly aimed at ramping up preparations for an aggressive war. This goes directly in contrast with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s claims that Ukraine currently wishes for normalization of the situation in Eastern Ukraine.

If peace was the aim, why would so much investment be needed in defense, especially when the country clearly has no funds, judging by the rumors of yet another IMF loan?

Furthermore, the announced “disarmament” of the Nazi-infested “volunteer battalions” left them with half their weapons in place, and it became apparent that they weren’t withdrawn from the frontline as it was suggested earlier.
