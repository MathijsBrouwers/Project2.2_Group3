The United States are planning to foment unrest and secessionism to force the territorial division of Venezuela in order to gain access to its natural resources. There are several areas as potential focus for an artificially-fuelled separatism: the Paraguaná peninsula (rich in hydrocarbons), the so-called ‘Western half-moon’ composed by the states of Zulia, Táchira and Mérida (rich in hydrocarbons, agrarian and farming products), the ‘Western triangle’ of the cities of Barquisimeto, Acarigua and Valencia (strategically decisive) and the region of Guayana (rich in minerals).
