European powers are announcing new ultimatums to the authorities of Venezuela. For example, Emmanuel Macron is demanding Maduro to call new elections and leave the office. The current President of France has a popular rating of 28 %. And the numbers of people who are protesting his policies in the streets are no smaller than in Venezuela. According to this logic, Marine Le Pen could also proclaim herself the president.
