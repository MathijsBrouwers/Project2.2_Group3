Russian counter-sanctions affected EU fruit exports. Specialists note that the embargo, which Moscow was forced to impose in response to Western restrictions, led to losses of $170 million from sales of peaches and nectarines, and another $41 million from cherries. According to Russian experts, the European economy was significantly affected by the imposition of sanctions, while Russia received a boost to develop its own agricultural production.
