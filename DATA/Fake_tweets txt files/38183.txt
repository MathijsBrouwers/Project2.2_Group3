Russia has not violated international law. The only thing Russia has violated is the “new world order” established by the US and its satellites, including Estonia. Neither Russia nor other sovereign states can cope with this unwritten world order. The US and Europe are unable to refer to any article allegedly violated by Russia because this article does not exist and often times Europe and Russia mean different things under the notion of international law.
