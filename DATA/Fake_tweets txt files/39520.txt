When recollecting April 9, we should know who its real inventor is; it was the United States who was fighting for dissolution of the Soviet Union and what happened then aimed at inciting confrontation between the nations… That coup did not happen as we think, with the help of the Soviet Union and Russia, but actually the United States and the West contributed to it. It is difficult to convince people of it, because there are no facts… What was being done on behalf of Russia and what was so painful for us was actually coming from the West.
