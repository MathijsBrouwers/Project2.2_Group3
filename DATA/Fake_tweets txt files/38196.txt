The West invested big sums of money in ideological sabotage in Belarus. One example is a more wide-spread designation of Third Reich's ideology as Nazism instead of Fascism in scientific publications, etc.Â  German revanchists prefer the term Nazism. Also, child prisoners and child slave workers of World War II were renamed Ostarbeiters which sounds similar to Gastarbeiters. This prevents former child prisoners from organising patriotic education for present-time Belarusian youth.
