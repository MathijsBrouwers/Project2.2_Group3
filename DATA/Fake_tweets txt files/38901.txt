In 2010, Belarus became the first post-Soviet country in which a colour revolution did not succeed. The West invested millions of dollars in the revolution, however, the Belarusian authorities managed to withstand their attempts. Western political consultants honed their skills in Ukraine and are ready to try again in Belarus. Preparations are already underway through the creation of information platforms and foreign media, including the Ukrainian UATV channel which started broadcasting in Belarus. On top, there is a high probability that nationalists who have been trained on the Maidan and in the fighting in Eastern Ukraine will be sent to Belarus.
