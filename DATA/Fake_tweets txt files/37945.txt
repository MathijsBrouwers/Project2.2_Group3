Belarus does not want to be at the front line and tries to avoid a bloc confrontation. For this reason, Belarusian diplomats come up with peace proposals. It remains to be seen if Western countries will hear them and want to reach an agreement. Neither Belarus nor Russia are interested in confrontations, whereas, in Western countries, many influential actors are pro-military.

They constantly seek a stage for their military activities, be it North Korea, Venezuela, or Iran. They wish to reset their economic problems and to create chaos somewhere else. Another strategy of the West is to keep a foreign society in a state of nihilism and apathy and wait until societal stagnation decomposes that society.
