Migrants are bringing crime and violence and they contribute substantially to Europe's decay. Eurostat's recent survey on the safest EU countries (Croatia, Poland and Slovakia) was used to 'prove' that security is directly dependant on the lack of immigrants and unwillingness to let them in. The same media also described the statistics on basic firearms licences in Germany, highlighting a substantial increase (of 130%) of licences and linking it to the bigger numbers of migrants in the country and a general increase in the murders, rapes and terror attacks caused by them.
