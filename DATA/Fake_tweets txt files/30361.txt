If you get the feeling that President Obama doesn’t really understand what it’s like to have to live under Obamacare … then this probably won’t make that feeling go away. 
On a conference call this afternoon, Obama tried to give enrollment staff a pep talk: . @POTUS tells ObamaCare enrollment staff they have to overcome the skeptics and prove to next Administration, the program is working well. 
— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) October 27, 2016 Despite rising health insurance premiums, @POTUS says tax credits will help eligible 7 in 10 find a plan for less than $75/month.

That pep talk included this little gem: "Have to clear the bugs off the windshield to see the road ahead," says Pres Obama on conference call with ObamaCare enrollment personnel.

So, if we’re understanding you correctly, Mr. President, Obamacare’s countless glitches and inadequacies and broken promises are just … pesky? Lost your plan? Lost your doctor? Higher premiums co-pays and deductibles? You're just a bug on the windshield! https://t.co/WhgW3MAHbA

This friggin’ guy … This guy lied repeatedly to the public and this is how he refers to the problems his law created. https://t.co/Ve8SHvMDz2

Nice, huh? @JimmyPrincetoni I guess those of us that are paying +50-60% more for health ins are dead bugs on a windshield. Nice. @markknoller 
— Kris Kinder (@kris_kinder) October 27, 2016 @markknoller The bugs on the windshield are the American people that are getting killed by Obamacare premiums and deductibles. 
— Matt Moyer (@mrmattmoyer) October 27, 2016 . @markknoller people being forced to pay thousands more for a shitty law we didn't want and he shrugs it off as bugs on a window? Smug POS 
— Dupes & Knaves (@DupesKnaves) October 27, 2016 "I lost my doctor & I'm paying a lot more for insurance now." 
POTUS: Hey, we gotta clear the bugs off the windshield to see the road ahead. 
— Jason C. (@CounterMoonbat) October 27, 2016 @markknoller concerns me more when hearing the likening of a nation's failed healthcare system to an everyday inconvenience 
— mark mark mark (@RevJimJonesInc) October 27, 2016 What about the big ones that just stick and smear everywhere? https://t.co/puTOzrb0Mi 
— Bigly Shoe (@TheOneSoleShoe) October 27, 2016 @markknoller If there are that many bugs, doesn't that indicate trouble? Blocks your view? 
— Kris Murphy (@KrisinAL) October 27, 2016 @markknoller I think it is more than bugs on this windshield.This Pres drove us right into it 
— Jean Tuttle (@waffle721) October 27, 2016 Except the bugs are huge. And angry. And still coming. And stole the windshield. And your car fell apart around you. https://t.co/JDx9Z3vYyW
