NATURE Vs. BAYER - Animals Invade Corporate HQ Share on Facebook Tweet 
More than a hundred animals invaded the office of Bayer in Brussels to protest its intensive lobbying for TTIP and denounce their corporate power consolidation in acquiring Monsanto for $66 billion. 
EZLN is a group of activists who are keen to reveal corporate dirty secrets by bringing nature back into those dirty offices. 
"We'll point out every guilty lobby in this city so that everybody knows where and when they act" - says Sous-Colonel Orang Outan. 
Something more to say ? YES : STOP TTIP ! [watch video below]
