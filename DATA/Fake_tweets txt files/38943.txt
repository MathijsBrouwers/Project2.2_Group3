On April 7, 2018, was Douma really victim of a chemical attack? And if yes, who committed it? OPCW's report reads: The toxic chemical was probably the molecular chlorine. It gives reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon occurred.Â The use of the term probably or "reasonable grounds" does not allow us to have any certainty.

Several British media have said that witnesses who appear in the video of the Douma hospital say themselves that the chemical attack on Douma was staged. The information was confirmed on Twitter by a BBC producer.
