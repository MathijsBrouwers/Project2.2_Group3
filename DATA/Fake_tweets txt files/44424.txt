The European Parliament falsifies history by declaring the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact to be the cause of WWII.

Parliamentarians accuse Russia of falsifying history. In doing so, the EU ignores its own guilt.

By concealing the unpleasant aspects of history and interpreting a retouched version of events at its own discretion, the European Parliament is finally losing all sense of reality. However, the reality is that Nazi criminals are being rehabilitated in some European countries, that Waffen-SS veterans and their supporters are moving en masse and that neo-Nazi organisations are feeling at home. This is now the real danger to the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.

Russia also strongly rejects the falsification of history. History must be written by responsible experts - not by politicians who misuse it for their own ends.
