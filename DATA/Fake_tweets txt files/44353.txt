The war in Donbas has started after Ukraine had abolished the law on regional languages. Many forget about this. The Russians in Ukraine remain Russians, but Ukraine banned education in the Russian language, prohibited children from learning Russian. This is the reason why the conflict in Donbas started. This was the reason for what has happened in both Donbas and Crimea.
