The UK intends to intervene in the presidential elections in Ukraine, which will be held in the country on March 31st. The British government wants to bring to power in Ukraine a "president with a new course" who would abandon the country's pro-Western path. That would help settle the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. This strategy is spelled out in the UK House of Commons report.
