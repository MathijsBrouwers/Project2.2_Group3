There are numerous discrepancies that give reason to doubt the official version of the Skripal Case. It is not a coincidence that the first person who gave first aid to the Skripals was the chief nurse of the British army, Alison McCourt.Â It is also no coincidence that she was first appointed Chief Nurse of the British Army on February 1. 2018, just a month before the incident with Skripal.
