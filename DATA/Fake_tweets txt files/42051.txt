Poland does not care about the peace in Eastern Ukraine, or in the East in general, nor about the well-being of the Ukrainians. The Polish politicians, thinking in the anti-Russian categories, perceive Ukraine as an important issue only if it harms Russia. Otherwise, if Ukraine stops harming Russia, the Polish politicians and publicists lose their interest in this country.
