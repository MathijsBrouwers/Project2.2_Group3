The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) proved that the concept of European rule of law is a hypothetical concept that does not exist in reality.

By rejecting an appeal against a landmark ruling that Soviet repressions against Lithuanian partisans can be treated as genocide, the ECHR is essentially rewriting the rule of law to fit the narrative that is being propagated in the mainstream media and diplomatic rhetoric in the last few months. It is similar to the recent attempts of rewriting history.
