The White Helmets kidnapped children to stage chemical attacks and for organ trafficking, from locations including eastern Aleppo and eastern Ghouta. They are accused of doing so in cooperation with al-Qaeda. There are videos showing that the White Helmets had themselves participated in terrorist atrocities against Syrian civilians. Evidence against this organisation is accumulating exponentially. A former MI6 agent is involved in propaganda about the White Helmets. There are doubts if the British government undertook all necessary precautions to ensure that it did not allow the presence of terrorists [White Helmets] on British soil.
