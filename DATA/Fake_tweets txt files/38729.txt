Fascism is spreading among the personnel in the Ukrainian military and police. In the volunteer battalions one always sees swastikas and similar Nazi symbols, but recently Fascism is spreading into the regular army and the National Guard. This was disclosed at a press conference in Moscow by a former officer of the Ukrainian State Security Services, Vasiliy Prozorov, currently a refugee in Russia.
