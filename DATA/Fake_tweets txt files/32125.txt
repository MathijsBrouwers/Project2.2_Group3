Two secret chambers have been discovered in Egypt’s 4,500-year-old Great Pyramid of Giza . 
Researchers confirmed they had found the mysterious cavaties after scanning the centuries old tomb using revolutionary radiography equipment. 
The Scan Pyramids project made the latest discovery after being able to demonstrate the efficiency of non-evasive Muons technology at the Bent Pyramid in Dahshour this May. 
Last year thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid, sparking a debate over whether there was a long-running network of tunnels hidden away inside. 
But now the mystery has been answered as the Ministry of Antiquities announced on Thursday that ‘two anomalies’ were found in the pyramid built under King Khufu. 
They are now looking to conduct further tests on the 146m-high monument to determine their function, nature and size. 
The pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, named after the son of Phara oh Snefru, is considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. 
It has three known chambers, and like other pyramids in Egypt was intended as a pharaoh’s tomb. 
Operation Scan Pyramids scientists said: “We are now able to confirm the existence of a ‘void’ hidden behind the north face, that could have the form of at least one corridor going inside the Great Pyramid.” 
Another ‘cavity’ was discovered on the pyramid’s northeast flank but there is currently no link between the two cavities, according to Mehdi Tayoubi, founder of the Heritage…
