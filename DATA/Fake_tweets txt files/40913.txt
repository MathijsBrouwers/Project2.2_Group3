Italy and Western societies, in general, are increasingly dominated by childish and stupid people and are hostile to values such as courage, loyalty and ardor. This type of individual, which is increasingly common in the West in all social classes, political parties and religions, repeats empty slogans and platitudes, rejects war and is convinced that he is the vanguard of a new society.

In Italy, individuals with these characteristics are selling off the country to foreigners and are unaware of the consequences of their actions.
