Sweden is thinking about sending its army to Donbass to support a UN mission. This was stated by the Minister of Defence of the country Peter Hultqvist.
Earlier,Â  Ukraine and Sweden have demanded that the results of the Battle of Poltava, which occurred on June 27 (July 8), 1709, should be cancelled, and Russia recognized as a loser. The initiative belongs to a group of activists of the Maidan and Scandinavian Society for Fair History, which consists of Swedish citizens of Ukrainian origin.
