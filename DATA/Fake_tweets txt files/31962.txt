Michael Moore is totally failing at getting Trump supporters to stop sharing the clip from his anti-Trump movie Posted at 5:23 pm   Greg P. 
As we told you yesterday , Michael Moore is royally pissed that Trump supporters having taken a 4-minute clip form his anti-Trump movie out of context and are sharing it as evidence of why Donald Trump will win in November. 
First he tried Snopes to try and convince people that his movie really isnâ€™t pro-Trump: Snopes points out those who have falsely edited a clip from my film to make it seem like something it's not. https://t.co/4u0XwyKU37

And then he posted a clip from the end of the film where he rips on Donald Trump: Here's the actual end to that scene in my film "Michael Moore In TrumpLand", the end Trump doesn't want u to see: https://t.co/RN10G91wGS

Except as of the publishing of this post, the anti-Trump ending has only had 15,000+ views:   
Now letâ€™s compare that to the YouTube video of the pro-Trump portion of the film that Donald Trump shared yesterday: I agree, @MMFlint â€“ To all Americans, I see you & I hear you. I am your voice. Vote to #DrainTheSwamp w/ me on 11/8. https://t.co/D7nBwkogBb

Trumpâ€™s link has 800,000+ views, and counting: 
And keep in mind, this doesnâ€™t even take into account the thousands and thousands of views different copies of this video have racked up. Like this single tweet with 25,000 retweets: If you make this go viral, Trump will win. It's 4 minutes that makes the choice in this election crystal clear. #EarlyVoting pic.twitter.com/UOgqSfet6a

Anyway, Moore will be on Bill Maherâ€™s show tonight where weâ€™re sure heâ€™ll continue to make the case that he really doesnâ€™t want Trump to get elected, even though Trump supporters love what he had to say: I'm on Bill Maher tonight. HBO. Live. 10pm ET. Our promise back in May: 2 "personally stop Trump, 2 stand in front of WH door if necessary."

As for that threat, our money is on the Secret Service figuring out a way to deal with the dual threat of a Maherâ€“Moore roadblock.
