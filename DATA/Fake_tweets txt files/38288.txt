There is no evidence of Russian interference in Western elections.
It is almost a tradition: as soon as elections take place somewhere, preferably in Western countries, warnings of possible Russian influence make the rounds. In the run-up to the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, this concern is also a worry for those responsible in the EU countries. However, there are no indications of any such activities from the Russian side.
