George Soros Is Preparing For Economic Collapse – Does He Know Something That You Don’t?   June 9th, 2016 
Why is George Soros selling stocks, buying gold and making “a series of big, bearish investments”? If things stay relatively stable like they are right now, these moves will likely cost George Soros a tremendous amount of money. But if a major financial crisis is imminent, he stands to make obscene returns. So does George Soros know something that the rest of us do not? Could it be possible that he has spent too much time reading websites such as The Economic Collapse Blog ? What are we to make of all of this? 
The recent trading moves that Soros has made are so big and so bearish that they have even gotten the attention of the Wall Street Journal … 
Worried about the outlook for the global economy and concerned that large market shifts may be at hand, the billionaire hedge-fund founder and philanthropist recently directed a series of big, bearish investments , according to people close to the matter. 
Soros Fund Management LLC, which manages $30 billion for Mr. Soros and his family, sold stocks and bought gold and shares of gold miners, anticipating weakness in various markets . Investors often view gold as a haven during times of turmoil. 
Hmmm – it sounds suspiciously like George Soros and Michael Snyder are on the exact same page as far as what is about to happen to the global economy. 
You know that it is very late in the game when that starts happening… 
One thing that George Soros is particularly concerned about that I haven’t been talking a lot about yet is the upcoming Brexit vote. If the United Kingdom leaves the EU (and hopefully they will), the short-term consequences for the European economy could potentially be absolutely catastrophic … 
Mr. Soros also argues that there remains a good chance the European Union will collapse under the weight of the migration crisis , continuing challenges in Greece and a potential exit by the United Kingdom from the EU. 
“ If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable ,” he said. 
The Brexit vote will be held two weeks from today on June 23rd, and we shall be watching to see what happens. 
But Soros is not just concerned about a potential Brexit. The economic slowdown in China also has him very worried, and so he has directed his firm to make extremely bearish wagers. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the last time Soros made these kinds of bearish moves was back in 2007, and it resulted in more than a billion dollars of gains for his company. 
Of course Soros is not alone in his bearish outlook. In fact, Goldman Sachs has just warned that “there may be significant risk to the downside for the market” … 
Goldman Sachs is getting nervous about stocks . 
In a note to clients, equity strategist Christian Mueller-Glissmann outlined the firm’s fears that there may be significant risk to the downside for the market. 
Ultimately, George Soros and Goldman Sachs are looking at the same economic data that I share with my readers on a daily basis. 
As I have been documenting for months, almost every single economic indicator that you can possibly think of says that we are heading into a recession . 
For instance, just today I was sent a piece by Mike Shedlock that showed that federal and state tax receipts are really slowing down just like they did just prior to the last two recessions… 
US federal personal tax receipts receipts are falling fast. So is the Evercore ISI State Tax Survey . 
The last two times the survey plunged this much, the US was already in recession. 
Is it different this time? 
And online job postings on LinkedIn have now been falling precipitously since February after 73 months in a row of growth … 
After 73 consecutive months of year-over-year growth, online jobs postings have been in decline since February. May was by far the worst month since January 2009, down 285k from April and down 552k from a year ago . 
Last week, the government issued the worst jobs report in nearly six years , and the energy industry continues to bleed good paying middle class jobs at a staggering rate. The following comes from oilprice.com … 
That may seem counterintuitive in an industry that has been rapidly shedding workers, with more than 350,000 people laid off in the oil and gas industry worldwide. 
Texas is one place feeling the pain. Around 99,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Lone Star state have been eliminated since prices collapsed two years ago, or about one third of the entire industry. In April alone there were about 6,300 people in oil and gas and supporting services that were handed pink slips. Employment in Texas’ oil sector is close to levels not seen since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. “ We’re still losing big chunks of jobs with each passing month ,” Karr Ingham, an Amarillo-based economist, told The Houston Chronicle . 
At this point it is so obvious that we have entered a new economic downturn that I don’t know how anyone can possibly deny it any longer. 
Unfortunately, the reality of what is happening has not sunk in with the general population yet. 
Just like 2008, people are feverishly racking up huge credit card balances even though we stand on the precipice of a major financial crisis… 
American taxpayers are quick to criticize the federal government for its ever-increasing national debt, but a new study released Wednesday found taxpayers are also saddled with debt, and are likely to end 2016 with a record high $1 trillion in outstanding balances. 
Wallethub, a site that recommends credit cards based on consumers’ needs, said that will be the highest amount of credit card debt on record, surpassing even the years during and before the Great Recession. The site said the record high was in 2008, when people owed $984.2 billion on their credit cards. 
Will we ever learn? 
This has got to be one of the worst possible times to be going into credit card debt. 
Sadly, the “dumb money” will continue to act dumb and the “smart money” (such as George Soros) will continue to quietly position themselves to take advantage of the crisis that is already starting to unfold. 
We can’t change what is happening to the economy, but we do have control over the choices that we make. 
So I urge you to please make your choices wisely.

Market watch had a story on Soros and his bearish predictions the last six years. Each time he’s made his bearish predictions, the market has gone up. Returns the last 5 months have been good ever since that bearish hysteria in January. Shedlock has been saying we are in a recession every week since 2011. 
Bear markets do happen every few years do these guys may be right this time. Broken clocks are sometimes right too. But consider the whole track record of these prognosticators Tim 
A few months ago a wealthy coworker told me that he had about $50k in the stock market, and he asked me if I thought that was a good idea. I told him that I wouldn’t have any money in stocks because I believe that a major correction is coming. He later told me that he had gotten out of stocks, and I told him that he was wise to do so. However, the correction that I spoke of still hasn’t started, and my coworker seems to have taken a different attitude toward me. 
I no longer talk about what I believe is coming because everything is so manipulated, and it makes me look like foolish when I’m wrong. I believe I’ll eventually be proven right. It’s just a matter of time. I just wonder how much longer they can keep this going. This is insane. ali 
Capital should always be diversify in a way so as to reduce exposure to a particular asset or risk. I think one should maintain a portfolio in gold as well as stocks and so on Since last 2 years I have missed some good opportunities to invest and get good returns in stock market, just thinking that the market collapse can be any moment. abc

You are not alone. 
I tried to get my Dad, now 80, to sell off most of his stock last year before the August/September, “possible” market collapse. he didn’t, good thing, and after the short drop for a couple months, most of his stock investment has now hit decade highs. With some hitting record highs. 
But, he has no other investments, and little savings, except some junk silver. In late ’08 I tried to get him to buy into a major stock that had dropped to less than 7 bucks a share. The average for the stock over the past twenty years had been about 17 to 20 bucks. I told him that he could easily double his money in less than two years. He didn’t listen because his broker talked him out of it. 
That stock doubled in the first year, and two weeks ago hit an all time high of 70 bucks a share. 
I believe a big sell off will happen this Fall. A lot of stocks are way over valued. Liberty First 
I encouraged my wife to put all of her retirements into cash at present. What have we got to lose? A small potential gain short term, perhaps. But in 3-4 years there will be major bottom feeding opportunities. Meanwhile, I have a ton of money in gold stocks and silver (SLV). Be patient. And also, spiritual. We know that in the long term we will be right. It takes patience to sit through it, and enjoying family and other things of permanent value make it easyier. michael malachi 
pretty good idea with the silver, but maybe we should – as a nation – forget about money for a bit and begin to focus on being a better friend, neighbor, father, mother, sister, brother etc. You cant take it with you when you die. You will be remembered and judged by your relationships and actions (works). It is time to help those in need and love others. Don’t forget the golden rule. Liberty First 
Very nice. JC Teecher 
For some of us, we have been doing just that for years and years, and some even decades and decades. We realize that the only thing you take with you from this life, is what you give away. 
However; there is nothing wrong with making money and becoming comfortably wealthy, as long as it doesn’t become one’s main agenda for everything. When greed takes precedence over charity, then it is time to unload it all and take up the cross. 
I have never looked down on poor or disabled people that are doing the best that they can with the hand they have been dealt. 
I look down on rich people that have the attitude, and especially those that “act” like they are rich, and act snooty towards others. sistersoldier 
Amen and amen again JC. Christ came that we might have life more abundantly. Believers are to love God and grow in wisdom as these things are first and foremost and are more important than money. Just as you have stated we cannot take anything with us as only what we do for Christ will last. Money is a transient possession that is used for this brief life but no longer. Proverbs teaches us that it is better to have a little money but be right with God than a lot of money you obtained unjustly. JC Teecher 
Amen to your thoughts as well. 
Most people don’t realize that we can be blessed with much more than we need, as a test, to see how we handle those blessings. 
The strings of prosperity sometimes ensnare us to the world. Our Father wants to know if our heart remains pure through the prosperous times as well as the lean. 
I have found myself, in times past, forgetting that all the prosperity can vanish in a day. Believe me, when I say I have been tested many times. 
The key is to not make the terrible mistake of blaming God when all the prosperity vanishes. ITSNOTWhatchaThink

I wish that you could have the out of body experience that I had back in 2003. It literally shook me to the core, and before it was over I was completely aware of being in the spirit realm, and in my spirit body. so were the thousands that were with me. 
It ‘s up to you, if you want to see it and feel it bad enough. Maybe i can help if at some point you have the desire to believe. Otherwise just accept that you have been blinded for your own protection, until the beginning of the Millennium, or until you give up the ghost/spirit. 
Best wishes. sistersoldier

Just a thought. I’m a fan of silver, but not necessarily of the SLV. Like the GLD, there are likely more contracts per ounce than ounces in the vault to back it. Paper silver is like other paper “assets.” The SLV is being manipulated by the big banks as was admitted to last month by Deutsche Bank. It is entirely possible that your SLV goes higher, but you may not be able to sell it for currency. Check out Bix Weir’s YouTube videos to get a deeper understanding of what I’m talking about. My suggestion would be to convert your SLV to SLW or convert to physical silver you can hold in your hand. Gay Veteran 
One day, SOON< that co-worker would have wished he took your advice! Tim 
He did take my advice by getting out of stocks. But he may have put his money back into stocks. I don’t know. Since the “correction” that I warned him about hasn’t materialized he doesn’t talk to me much anymore. Frankie 
I would not waste any more time worrying about this person Tim. You gave advice that you thought was correct. We are all adults, this person CHOSE to listen to your advice, and probably got further information from other sources as well. YOU didn’t FORCE him to sell his stocks, he CHOSE to do it and instead of ignoring you and now not speaking he should “OWN” his own decision to do what he did. I am of the same ilk as you, I have been preparing for some time for a MAJOR collapse. We think 2008 was bad??? Wait for it!! People have no idea, do not think it is remotely possible that the entire world could collapse with everything that is happening across the globe. I once wanted to help everyone but I realised a long time ago people have to want to help themselves. So now I am concentrating on myself and my family. I truly believe really bad times are coming. People need to learn to be RESILIENT. Those who you thought were friends will become enemies in their desperation, you will need to learn how to defend yourselves and how to “economise” and I am not talking “money” here, I am talking the basic necessities for life.

How SOON? TrumpGodzillaRising 
It’s wise to stay silent and simply observe, prepare your own sphere of influence as best you can and that’s about it as collapse accelerates. You’ll find that people become more insane as collapse accelerates. Jews never believed they were being sent off to be gassed even as they were herded onto the trains. Today we know different. Ignore the race hating a sec, focus on events as they are, reality as it is. 
I think Soros recognises it’s the global political dimension finally coming to a head, in other words, the people have finally had enough, you can see this globally in so many nations with so many problems converging to create this perfect storm that will feed off itself. 
We all know that none of the problems were solved post 2008, they were made infinitely worse. Here we are as predicted, 2015-2020 the collapse would accelerate and war would be the likely outcome when politics and diplomacy fails. In fact war is simply a continuation of politics.

When you have truth to offer – that truth must be brought out into light by sharing it with all who would listen. That is the job of a watchman. The problem is that too many see themselves as watchmen and most are just giving their opinions. A true watchman will have a true word of God that can not be refuted, but will likely be ignored. Opinionists tend to know it all and will make every effort to convince others that they are right. jox 
A watchman that ‘have a true word of God that can not be refuted’ doesn’t exist. michael malachi

Genesis 6:13 – Noah’s day. 
What happened in his day, set in rough 1600 years since Adam and Eve? well, the population increased and so did evil. 
God is the still observing and been patient and kind by allowing us/them long enough to live and hear the Gospel. 
He has called believers in Him to become fishers of men the salty influence in a society engorged in decadence. He sees and knows all, is what they preach, for His own word testifies and verifies the disciples experience. The Spirit sanctifies them. 
His Sovereignty is unquestionable, beyond ours to fully appreciate, yet become a man like us. 
Different men use different bait but the message the true message is Peace with God through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The fire of Gods wrath has been satisfied in Him and He was raised for their justification and new life, eternal life in Jesus. 
Where is He now? 
How naïve men are to think He don’t exist, 
enslaved to god of this age, in their sin. 
We see it in our children. In all men. 
Only His blood can cleanse the heart from sin. 
The Christians see verses like these and understands, 
believes, that a Holy Trinity is their One God, that glorious praise of the redeemed.

Collectively their message to the world is to endure in His grace, the ministry of reconciliation…. “Be reconciled to God.” 
In view of the Day of Christ, they are empowered by His grace to endure in their place the life, worth of the Gospel 
Philippians 1:27-29“Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved and that by God. For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for him,…. Yet, God causes all these things to work for their good. TrumpGodzillaRising

I would tell him about this site, and ask him to use his own discernment, and tell him to visit this site often. The best manner, in which to talk about these things, is in terms of exactly what you just stated. That you know that something is coming, and it will be some time in the near future, but things are being manipulated, and it could come tomorrow, or it could be a little more time yet. Tell him that it’s a good thing that it is being held off, so it gives people time to pray and prepare. Ask him if he is preparing, both physically and spiritually.

I know nothing about the precious metals market, but it seems there are a lot of people buying into it in some form or fashion. What i wonder about is that PM do not seem to be supported very much in the world: Meaning what are there? A small amount of buyers & sellers? What does a person do who wants to buy gold? Go to their local stamp & coin collectors store, pawn shop, or maybe order from some business online? It seems to me that if the banks and other financial institutions bought and sold gold coins & bullion, it would be part of the monetary system – i am talking about over-the-counter purchases & sales, or exchanges for paper money. Theoretically if the two businesses in some town went out of business you would have to find another broker in some other town to liquidate your gold coins or whatever you have in the form of gold. Nobody wants gold – just specialty buyers & sellers and that is during relatively stable times. In a large worldwide financial collapse with maybe PM merchants out of business then who is going to buy your PM? I do not think that PM are given the respect that they need in order to be a viable source of security. When i was in Vietnam the people there were always converting cash into gold & it probably worked for them well – but i do not think it was to make a profit but to protect their savings in case they were unable to trade their currency or if the north vietnamese over-ran the country they would be able to buy the new national currency. It is just something i wonder about. Not trying to start an argument. moulesnfrites 
The Greeks who held physical gold and silver and FIAT currency outside of the banking system are doing much better than those Greeks who can only access sixty euros a day, for the past two years. I am sure the same applies to the Venezuelans and Argentinians currently. 
Only a fool trusts government and banks. Take responsibility and choose the red pill. 
A lot of the Jews who escaped Europe in the late 1930s only got past the border guards because of gold and silver. Thousands of years of history with gold and silver compared with about fifty years maximum for any FIAT currency. All FIAT currencies in history have failed. Diggin the Dirt

Goiter-faced, slurping neo-con McCain never had a chance to win the 2008/2009 election. America was sick of war mongers like him regardless of what the economy was doing. No, the true powers that run the country had already decided for either Obama or Hillary to be the next ruse in line. Ultimately they told Hitlery that she would have to wait her turn–now they are incensed because someone is running who is not part of their machine and they didn’t give him permission to run for president.

Companies will not return because of all the nonsense diversity laws. Companies succeed by hiring the best, not through quotas. K2 
What are those pl elaborate algol2000 
Diversity= spend hard earned resources looking for and hiring women, negros, homosexuals even though they were not the best-in-class. It sends a message to the population that meritocracy is dead, and all they have to do is look pretty. Don’t get me wrong, I am negro. K2 
Those laws have already been passed? gardeauxandrew 
The lowering of standards to pacify sure dumbs down Everyone in America and the world! mtntrek3 
I wish decent paying jobs would return, but…… . How to get past corporate greed. Push our wage scales down equal to cheap slave labor costs? Ha,that’s the ticket. This crap going on is sheer greed and power plays. Neither side politically has any real interest in reversing this trend. Trump……… well the day he puts his money where his mouth is and quits indulging in cheap overseas labor to make his clothing line among other things ( which won’t happen because he’s a part of the problem) is the day I would start believing him. He’s a corporate weasel like so many others. He panders to the working class to get votes. Then he’ll start his “utopia” as the full fledged dictator he is. I don’t like many if any of the jerks in politics. He’s a jerk of another kind. He wins the grand prize. Bill G Wilminton NC

“House Republicans asserted the State Department knew immediately that the Benghazi attack was linked to a terrorist group and said there were 600 requests for additional security at the Benghazi compound. Mrs. Clinton said some of those requests were fulfilled, though most of those messages didn’t rise to her level and were handled by the department’s security professionals.” Hillary didn’t murder anyone. She could only know as much as she was informed. Bill G Wilminton NC 
There were special forces in Sicily and they could have been in Benghazi in 4 hours….the buck stops at the Secretary of State……Hillary might as well have shot that mortar on the Marines on that roof….. 
Hillary is The Benghazi Murderer….

Oh and let’s not forget the Benghazi Murderer tag. Bahahahaaa yep, I’M the ridiculous one alright. Frankie

Like I have already said you are supporting a woman who wont even say the words ISLAMIC TERRORIST and she is running for president she should be told to step down . She is a disgrace.

After Trumps speech tomorrow nite maybe you ( Snotnose ) will be elected FOOL OF THE YEAR on this blog site…. ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
Media/politicians don’t blurt things the way you want them. They wait until they have facts before they run their mouth. You want BIGMOUTH Trump? You’ll be sorry. Bill G Wilminton NC 
Trump is the only one stating facts…..he has been telling everyone STOP the MUSLIMS from coming into OUR COUNTRY…. He has been saying this for months and months…… 
Hillary and the other scumbag obama cant even say ISLAMIC TERRORIST and obama calls ISIS ISIL…. The democratic party should demand that obama step down from the Presidency and Hillary should be replaced as the dem candidate. 
VOTE TRUMP the only one stating the facts !. CASTIEL 
If she wins better prepare your bunker Trump could have defects but she is the devil….how she will solve the situation in Ukraine and Syria and South China without starting a ww3? Because things are escalating to the worse.. ITSNOTWhatchaThink

Forget it Bill. You’re a sexist old chauvinist, but don’t condemn the country to a bombastic fool who has never governed. Bill G Wilminton NC 
Hillary is THE FOOL… she and the other scumbag “obama” wont even say ISLAMIC TERRORIST….well Omar ” the Muslim ” the Orlando shooter claims ISIS connections. Omar knows he was a Muslim Terrorist the only one who doesnt know is HILLARY. 
The bombastic fool is Hillary and the mothers of those 3 marines would sure like to talk to hillary ” The Big Fat As*ed Fool” with the $15,000 jacket to cover that fat butt. 
Tomorro nite Trump has scheduled a speech and after that speech I wouldnt be surprised if You and Hillary and all you Hillary Fools arn’t run out of town on the brooms you flew in on…..whoosh cackle cackle cackle….good riddance ! CASTIEL

Asshole, Trump would be the soonest one to start ww3 CASTIEL 
From what i read in the news….Trump is against the sanctions to Russia and want better relations with that country and Hillary said once that Iran should be nuked….nuked????So idiot you are going to do the same mistake when you voted OBAMA? a wolf dressed as a sheep. ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
Trump is a political NOBODY. He has never done a political thing in his life other than run for president. You’re EFFIN STUPID CASTIEL 
Political things? society dont need politicals but real leaders…..so you want someone who have experience in steal and lie to the people? you are really dumb….Like those German idiots who voted Merkel that defend the invasion of these muslims….you are going to vote for hillary because she is the first women with chances for the Presidency …like you voted in Obama because he was the first black in the white house….thinking that will cause any change….your stupidity have no limits. ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
You and the lil boys don’t like her, but she’s a proven effective leader w/realms of knowledge on political workings far beyond Trump. Stop being a moron. CASTIEL 
She is a warmonger…she will start a ww3…politicians dont know nothing about war…they think its just a game to gain some money until the day they encounter a strongh opponent..political knowledge is irrelevant….JFK was a great President not because of his political experience but yes by his beliefs thats why he was killed…Nowadays they are all pupets and corrupt…dont you understand? its irrelevant…..

HILLARY the MURDERER needs to be in a JAIL HOUSE not the White House !. 
“What difference does it make now” says Hillary about the three dead Marines and Ambassador Stevens at BENGHAZI.

Your vote for Hildabeast will result in you and your family dead in a FEMA camp!!!! If your side wins you will end at the hand of the Gov you voted for —poetic justice ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
Trump has no government experience. He succeeded by bankrupting companies. Bill G Wilminton NC 
VOTE TRUMP he has NO GOVERNMENT experience !. sistersoldier 
You know who else has no previous government experience? Governor Bruce Rauner of Illinois. That is working out great! (facetious). However I do not support Hillary either I think America needs a leader and not a repeater. ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
Hillary will win! 😀 She may not be popular on this board, but the type that habitates this board is happily a minority. Bill G Wilminton NC 
YUP she is not popular on this board and not popular with the mothers of the three Marines she left to DIE on that roof. 
PUT THE BENGHAZI MURDERER IN JAIL !. ITSNOTWhatchaThink

She’s far from popular outside of America…MURDERESS!!! ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
How much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. it’s only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next we’ll grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery! 
Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being ” The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II” and Grant “Commanding General of the United States Army” How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! 
“no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump’s casino empire in the last 30 years.” He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks it’s just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Bill G Wilminton NC 
VOTE TRUMP….He is not a TRAITOR POLITICIAN !. 
POLITICIANS put us 20 trillion in DEBT !. gfmucci 
And “political experience” is good how? WeRThrough 
Please tell us what “experience” the current monkey in power had? Oh and while you are at it, please list his accomplishments besides the implosion of this country. RedSky 
Just one thing, how can you bring manufacturing back when the demand globally has fallen off the charts? This is not just a problem here, it is everywhere on the planet. Trump does have a better handle on what is going on for sure but I doubt he will be able to fix it but anything is better than “Billary” where we will see more war on innocent people. autofixer 
Just a note. Manufacturing IS returning to the U.S., it has been. The problem is that it is returning to automated (robotic) factories. It turns out Mexicans and Chinese are cheaper than North Americans, yet robots are even cheaper than Mexicans or Chinese. Bill G Wilminton NC 
Autofixer Good point…. but there are still manufacturing operations with water fountains for people…..take Carrier Airconditioner who employed 1400 people…. they just recently up and moved to Mexico along with Nabisco and Ford…. 
Trump as a kick butt leader will figure a way to claw them back plus thousands more…….that is what ya get as a businessman as President vs some corrupt Polititical hack loser like Hillary. 
Vote Trump ITSNOTWhatchaThink 
To show you what a DIMWIT NAIVE LIL RICH BOY Trump is.. “Donald Trump says Orlando victims could have saved themselves if they were armed” Omar was armed with AR-15 type assault gun which fires 30 rounds a minute. Could you imagine being close enough in a crowded chaotic dance bar to take him out within 2 minutes? That’s your IDIOT BOY talking!!! Bill G Wilminton NC 
Trump is the only candidate who spoke about stopping the Muslim immigration !. Hillary wants a 500 % increase in Muslim immigration. 
And being armed is becoming a NECESSITY… going to a drinking/dancing establishment is not !. Niteclubs are just bars and it is not permissible to bring a weapon so the muslim freak goes to a GUN FREE ZONE. 
Hillary for the first time today used the words “Islamic Terrorism”….obama still has not used this term. Hillary and obama blame the attack on GUNS. 
VOTE TRUMP and keep your guns oiled, loaded and ready and remember Hillary wants your guns and wants Muslim immigration increased. gfmucci
