The Russophobic collective West currently pursues the same policy towards the Ukrainian authorities as it did in 1938 towards Nazi Germany,Â that is the policy of appeasement and pushing for war with Russia. The anti-human/anti-Russian policy of Ukrainian nationalists is a manifestation of European values. Through the calls to destroy Moscow, Ukrainian nationalists voice the secret intentions of the so called Western democracies. In reality, Western countries have nothing to do with democracy, they pursue fascist and racist policies.
