The only way for Trump to lose the election is to get himself be misled in a major conflict. The pressure applied on him by the US intelligence community and the so-called “Middle Eastern allies” of the US starts to kick in. He may fall victim of a provocation or a false-flag event, even though he knows that he must avoid the actual shooting war in the Persian Gulf at all costs. Trump will be elected for a second term only if he dares to openly oppose the CIA, Tel-Aviv and Riyadh.
