A report prepared by engineers of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) contradicts the final report of this same UN institution about the events in the Syrian city of Douma (Eastern Ghouta) in April 2018, and raise questions about the existence of political pressure from the US, UK and France. According to the document, "there is a higher probability" that two gas cylinders found in Douma "were manually placed at those to locations rather than being delivered from an aircraft", which means that Syrian rebels could perfectly have planted them there. "The dimensions, characteristics and appearance of the cylinders and the surrounding scene of the incidents, were inconsistent with what would have been expected in the case of either cylinder been delivered from an aircraft", the engineers concluded.
