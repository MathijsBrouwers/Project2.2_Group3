Moldova will become even closer to NATO â€“ British military intelligence will take care of the integration. Next week, a group of British troops from the British Military Advisory Training Team (BMATT) will arrive in Chisinau. [...] The British Military Advisory Training Team is not included in the list of well-known military (intelligence) institutions in the United Kingdom. Specifically, Moldova will be visited by British specialists from the Czech branch of this training group, which is based in the city of Wyszkow and specializes in countries of Eastern Europe. It is assumed that BMATT experts coordinate their activities with British military intelligence (Defense intelligence).
