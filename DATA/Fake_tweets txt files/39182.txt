The current situation in Ukraine is institutionalised terrorism that poses a threat to the nation and the world. The EuroMaidan-protests in Ukraine led to a coup supported by the US and the EU.The situation today is a shame, the "heroes" of today's Ukraine are pogrom makers, anti-Semites and all sorts of radicals.
