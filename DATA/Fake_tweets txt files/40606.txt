Denmark, which has previously sparked controversy with its unorthodox ways of slaughtering animals deemed unfit for breeding and dissecting them in front of the public, has taken things to a whole new level by collecting people's unwanted house pets as feed for carnivores.For those willing to do away with their pet, hungry predators at the Copenhagen Zoo and Givskud Zoo are more than ready to take over. Both zoos are eagerly accepting pet animals as feed for carnivores like lions, tigers, wolves and Tasmanian devils.
