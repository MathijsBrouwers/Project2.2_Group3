When you think about the frequent shootings in the US, Is this not the way the US acts the world over - ruins countries, provokes civil wars, drives whole nations into poverty and misery, sets up sanctions to those who in the Europe want to buy cheap Russian gas, organises coups and colour revolutions, continues to occupy Germany and Japan, conducts wars without UN sanction under false pretences and fake coalitions.
