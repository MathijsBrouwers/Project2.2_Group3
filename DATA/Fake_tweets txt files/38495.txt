Russia fully respects the norms of international law. If there are some who feel offended, Russia has nothing to beg pardon for. Russia does everything that meets the norms of international law and the United Nations Charter. Russia respects the right of peoples to self-determination, including that of ethnic minorities, whether in Crimea or another regions. Sanctions will be ineffective in putting pressure on both Russia and other countries that respect their history and identity.
