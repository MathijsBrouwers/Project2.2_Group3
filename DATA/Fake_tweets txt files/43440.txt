Greta Thunberg proposed the UN General Assembly to deny the achievements of human civilisation, neglect economic development and material well-being for the sake of saving nature. This "positive agenda" is not new, it was made a reality in the Baltic states after the USSR collapsed. They fought the so-called "legacy of occupation" using ecological slogans. This all resulted in the complete degradation of the Baltic states.

The Western liberal ruling elite promotes the programme of the future through Greta. This programme is extremely regressive as it denies human creative powers, science and progress and proposes the past to the world.

The Baltic states made this programme of deliberate simplification, degradation, and archaisation real. Under the mottoes for saving nature, they run through the Bacchanalia of de-industrialisation and de-intellectualisation. The Baltic States can take some credit for the ecological situation though. The remaining small population only happens to be bothered by beavers and wild boars walking in downtown Riga. Hence, the path proposed by Greta Thunberg leads to the dying-out as the case of the Baltic states proves.
