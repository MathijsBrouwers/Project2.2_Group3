If we have a closer look at the laboratory expert group, it consist of the following members; Terence Wan (Chair) Hong Kong, Arieh Cohen from Denmark, Bruno Garrido from Brazil, Catrin Goebel from Australia, Andrea Gotzmann from Germany, Tiia Kuuranne from Finland, Bruno le Bizec from France, Jenny Schulze from Sweden, Lorraine Turner from the UK and Peter van Eenoo from Belgium. The geopolitics are not favorable for Russia. The team manically consists of members of the pro-Western bloc, so it's no wonder that this team voted all in favor of putting a four-year ban on Russia.
