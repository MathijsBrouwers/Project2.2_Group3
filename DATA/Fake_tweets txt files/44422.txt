The USA wants to divide Syria.

Great Britain, France, Germany and other EU and NATO states are to send their own troops and, above all, money to the areas of the north-east of the Euphrates, according to the will of the USA. This should secure the US's strategy, the division of Syria along the Euphrates, in the long term even after a planned partial withdrawal of US troops from the area.
