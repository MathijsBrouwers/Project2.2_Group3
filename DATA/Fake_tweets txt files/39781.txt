Ukrainian universities force students to write a rejection letter and cut off contacts with their Russia-based relatives. "For connections with Russia, my niece can be expelled from the institute. She sends me WhatsApp messages from someone else's phone. She is afraid to write me from her own device. Everyone there is scared," says Ekaterina Jankovic, a Ukrainian living now in Russia.


Jankovic is sending food to her niece in Odesa.
