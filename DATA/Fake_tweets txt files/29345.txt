The lawlessness of the Obama Administration knows no bounds.
Not only has President Obama made every move he can through executive order to create and foster amnesty for illegal immigrants, but his Justice Department is now attempting to force people to hire undocumented workers.
Ironically, the agency on the other end of intimidation is the Denver County Sheriff’s Office.
Incredibly backwards…
via the Daily Caller :
Denver County’s sheriff office has been slapped with a fine by the Department of Justice (DOJ) because it refused to hire non-citizens as deputies. 
From the beginning of 2015 through last March, the Denver Sheriff Department went on a major hiring binge, adding more than 200 new deputies. But those jobs ended up only going to citizens, because the department made citizenship a stated requirement on the job application . The department admitted as much in a new settlement with the U.S. government, which requires it to pay a $10,000 fine. 
The department will also have to comb through all of its job applications from the past two years, identifying immigrants who were excluded from the hiring process and giving them due consideration. 
How can someone be hired to enforce the law, if they are living in violation and ignorance of it?
How can counties, state agencies, small businesses or individuals be forced to hire in violation of the law, in order to comply with non-discrimination?
Obviously the system has a logical loop failure, either that, or someone wants this country to eat itself.
