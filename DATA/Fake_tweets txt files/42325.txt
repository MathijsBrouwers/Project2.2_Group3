Russian armed forces have struck the Field Operations Room in Aleppo, supposedly manned by intelligence officers of the USA, UK, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Some 24 people are reported to have been killed. Western media are purposefully ignoring the event. The strikes were conducted 'immediately after the US attacks on Syrian armed forces in Deir ez-Zor in support of ISIL'.
