There are two scenarios of the US launching war against Russia. The first envisages a US military attack using all available means, including nuclear weapons. The second scenario envisages Russia's economic isolation in order to induce a "change of political leadership". The likelihood of combat action is quite real, as Washington may urgently need a "fairly large war".
