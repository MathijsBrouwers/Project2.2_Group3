While many campaign ads feature candidates and their surrogates slinging the proverbial mud at their opponents, Travis County (Austin, TX) Commissioner Gerald Daugherty tried something a little different: he had his friends, his neighbors, and even his wife sling a little (good-natured) mud at him. 
The resulting ad was so touching and relatable that Americans of all political stripes are calling it “the best political ad of the entire election”: my favorite political ad of the year, for a Texas county commish @teamdaugherty https://t.co/tBVtTde4sF — Jon Ward (@jonward11) October 24, 2016 Fun ad: "Please re-elect Gerald" to the county commission so he'll stop annoying his family with policy nerdery. https://t.co/5LiiBpfg6X — Josh Barro (@jbarro) October 27, 2016 
“Re-Elect Gerald...Please” even got the attention of Hollywood: "Please re-elect Gerald." Best political Ad of the election. https://t.co/BAuGdWLrTx — Jenna Fischer (@jennafischer) October 26, 2016 Okay. This is the funniest campaign ad ever!!!

Even liberal bastion The Daily Kos is suggesting that their readers “put party politics aside” and watch the hilarious ad. 
Daugherty, who was a one-time prospect for the Boston Red Sox, has channeled his energy into a platform of “good roads and fiscal responsibility”...and, apparently, savvy advertising.
