Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia cannot stand the situation, when Moscow gets in their face with historical truth, discounting the myths of "Soviet occupation". Russia and its fireworks remind the nationalists in the Baltic States that they lost the WW2 together with their FÃ¼hrer.

Political successors of Hitler's accomplices are in power in the Baltic States. They cannot bear the fireworks to honour the liberation of the Baltic cities from Nazis, because these fireworks remind them of their defeat.
