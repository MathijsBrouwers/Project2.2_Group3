Russia’s defense ministry’s official spokesperson, Major General Igor Konashenkov, has reported that Su-33 fighters based on the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier cruiser have killed no less than 30 militants from the Jebhat al-Nusra grouping in the Syrian province of Idlib. As Konashenkov reported on Tuesday, militants have suffered serious losses as a result of “massive fire strikes” and a large bandit grouping of al-Nusra has been destroyed. 
According to General Konashenkov, the death of least 30 terrorists as been confirmed by multiple intelligence channels. Also confirmed among the dead were field commanders Muhammad Khelala, Abu Jaber Harmuja, and Abul Baha al-Asfari, who was planning an offensive on Aleppo. Al-Asfari was responsible for the unification of the remnants of Al-Nusra reserves in Aleppo and Hama.  
As stated earlier this week by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, Russia has begun a large strike operation inflicting fire damage on Islamic State and Jebhat Al-Nusra positions in the Syrian provinces of Idlib and Homs.  
The Admiral Kuznetsov heavy aircraft carrier cruiser, the only cruiser of its class in the Russian Navy, has been engaged in the operation. The cruiser is now in the Mediterranean Sea at the head of the Northern Fleet. 

Also participating in the operation is the Admiral Grigorovich frigate (a guard ship) which, according to defense ministry reports, has struck the positions of militants in Syria with Calibre cruise missiles.
