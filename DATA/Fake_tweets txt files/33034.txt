Next Prev Swipe left/right One branch of Burger King perfectly trolled McDonald’s for Halloween When big brands try to be sassy, it often backfires and they end up looking like the corporate version of Alan Partridge , but every now and then one big brand prank slips through the net of lameness. In this case, it’s just one branch of Burger King, in New York, that has managed to come up with something funny and seasonal as it dressed the whole building as the ghost of McDonald’s. 
Picture credit: Burger King As if that wasn’t throwing enough shade at ‘dead’ McDonald’s, they wrote on their sign “B ! Just kidding. We still flame grill our burgers. Happy Halloween”, which is a reference to the fact that McDonald’s fries its burgers rather than grilling them, something fast food fans might care about. Possibly. 
Several people had something to say about it on Twitter. Well played, Burger King. Well played. pic.twitter.com/hQSLRj11jX
