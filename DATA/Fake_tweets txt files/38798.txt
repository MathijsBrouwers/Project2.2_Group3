Macron has no power. It is not him who decides. Macron is only a governor of the province of France, of a kind of entity under the domination of an industrial financial oligarchy that took power in Brussels. He's only pretending to have power which he has not.

There is a big secret in French politics: all big strategic choices (privatisation of SNCF, EDF, the attacks on pensions, labour lawâ€¦) are codified by the report on strategy for economic policies published yearly in Brussels in order to favour the convergence of economies, to save the euro.
