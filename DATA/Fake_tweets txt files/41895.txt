An analyst from the Heritage Foundation, Luke Coffey, voiced the idea of the Armenian lobby in the US, to bring Syrian Armenians to Georgia and to settle them under the protection of the US military base in Samtskhe-Javakheti. If the US military base opens in Akhalkalaki, it will be followed by support "civilian personnel" of Armenian nationality.
