Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was in the Camp Bucca detention center inside a US base in Iraq for about five years "under the auspices of the United States." As he was leaving the detention centre, Al-Bahdadid said "see you in New York guys". This implies that he knew many US officers and soldiers in the detention centre hailed from New York City. There are many question marks about how a terrorist organisation would give allegiance to a leader who had just come out of a US base after five years in detention, and earlier why he had been released without trial, or even not sent to Guantanamo like other terrorists.
