Activities of foreign agents in Armenia should be strictly controlled by the state. Open Society Foundations-Armenia, as well as dozens of other foundations and NGOs in Armenia, are serving foreign agendas. In fact, these agendas are aimed at the collapse of Armenian statehood and the disintegration of society. The proof was the coup d’état in Armenia in 2018. Moreover, those organisations are doing dirty work, which foreign embassies do not implement directly.

Activists will continue to expose these structures, states, embassies, workers, and local collaborators. From ordinary propagandists to the President and Prime minister of the Republic of Armenia.
