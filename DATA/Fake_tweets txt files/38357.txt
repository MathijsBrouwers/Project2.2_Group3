This year, two great churches of Paris were the object of fires. In the opinion of the most knowledgeable specialists, the Notre-Dame fire is a criminal arson because it could not come unexpectedly like that, on the beams which make a square meter of section and which are 700 years old. Try burning an oak log and you'll see what it takes.
It's probably the work of an intelligence service, because the equipment and the spread of the flame required organisation that probably goes beyond a personal initiative.
These fires must be a warning. For years, we have been denouncing the transfer of population from non-European countries to Europe, especially to France.
