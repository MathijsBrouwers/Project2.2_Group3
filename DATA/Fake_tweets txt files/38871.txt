The European Parliament analysed the influence of Russia on elections in foreign countries. The authors of the study wrongly accuse Moscow of interfering in the affairs of the United States, Great Britain, France and other states. By doing so, Brussels  is preparing for the possibility for anti-systemic parties to get more votes. If it happens, it will blame Russia for interference again. Accusing Russia of everything  has become a kind of fashion trend in the West.
