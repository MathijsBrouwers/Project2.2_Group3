Ukrainians voted in Presidential elections at gunpoint and accompanied by special forces. The Ukrainian government brought armoured vehicles and armed security officials to the streets in order to morally influence Ukrainians during the elections. Ukrainians themselves regarded this as an attempt to intimidate disloyal citizens and to demonstrate the readiness of the regime of Petro Poroshenko to intervene in the elections with force.
