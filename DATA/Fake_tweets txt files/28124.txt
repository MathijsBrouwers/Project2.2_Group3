Forget Hillary Clinton … she can’t even get more than a handful of people to attend her rallies. 
So why on earth would you hold an event with Tim Kaine? Can they possibly expect more than three, maybe four people to show up? 
But that’s what they did at Lorain’s Admiral King High School in Ohio. They held the rally in the school’s gym, hoping to fill it up with students. Waiting for Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Kaine to speak at #Lorain Admiral King school. pic.twitter.com/A74ve1eKkF

Students and other attendees (supporters, supposedly) wondered what the point of Kaine’s appearance was in the first place.

Maybe it was (yawn!) Sen. Al Franken that got everyone all excited. Gearing up for Democratic Party nominee for Vice President Tim Kaine & Sen. Al Franken in #Lorain @LorainSchools @MorningJournal pic.twitter.com/47IucfCrsG

I think – at most – there are 150 people there. 
Remember folks, Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s VP Pic spoke to an overflow crowd of more than 2,300 people in Utah on Wednesday.
