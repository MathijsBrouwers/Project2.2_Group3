The UK's anti-Russian provocation has entered its final phase: London is preparing the global audience for Sergei Skripal's death, and will announce it when a favourable moment arrives (e.g., Brexit or a possible "expropriation" of Russian assets). 

In fact, Skripal is already dead because he refused to cooperate with the provocateurs, the British. They will summon his ghost whenever they deem it suitable.
