Belarus has always been part of Russia and has never been a subject of the political world. However, Minsk has begun positioning the country as if it is a distinct small country. The West has noticed and given the approval of Lukashenka's attempts to distance from Russia. The West strengthens Lukashenka in many ways and blessed him to have a conflict with Russia. The plan is to impose a new identity on Belarusians, a Catholic, Central-European, and Polish-Lithuanian identity.

However, Lukashenka will not succeed in building an autonomous Belarusian duchy with Polish-Lithuanian identity and succession of power. Lukashenka committed the gravest mistake by turning away from Russia and by believing in an alliance with fascist Ukraine and a bloc of Western countries. Russia will not turn away from the path of restoration of the territorial unity of the historical statehood, returning the territories of historic Russia. If Lukashenka attempts to blackmail both Russia and the West, the West will stage a coup in Belarus.
