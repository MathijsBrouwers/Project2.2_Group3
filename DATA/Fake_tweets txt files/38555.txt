Warsaw has refused Russian offers to take part in the renovation of a World War II museum in Sobibor, under way since 2014. Three separate requests -- all made by private Russian institutions -- were rejected on spurious grounds and obviously for political reasons.

By doing so, Poland is trying to rewrite history and deny Russia's role in the liberation of Poland in general, and in the history of the Sobibor camp in particular. After all, it was a Red Army officer, Aleksandr Pechersky, who organized the 1943 Sobibor uprising, one of the few successful ones in the history of the Holocaust.

Vladimir Putin was not invited to the 70th anniversary event commemorating the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, held in Poland in 2015.
