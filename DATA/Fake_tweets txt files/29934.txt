Doreen Virtue – It’s a powerful and intense week with the Angel Numbers 11-11 which is a sign of instant manifestation, and the upcoming election and impending Super-Super Full Moon of November 14. 
You will be in touch with your God-given spiritual power of being a healer and a positive role model for those who are stressed. Yet, you’ll also need to take time for yourself – ideally a quiet retreat (even for a few moments each day). 
You may feel the effects of the upcoming powerful full moon, with sleep issues, sensitivity, or mood swings. Avoid anyone or anything that trigger you.
