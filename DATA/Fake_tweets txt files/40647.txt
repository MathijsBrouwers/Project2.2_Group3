The decision of Donald Trump to move the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is "a continuation of the strikes on Russia" with the aim of destabilizing inter-ethnic and inter-confessional relations in Russia. Indeed, one of the most explosive things is the problem of interethnic relations in Russia. In the 90s the US tried to blow it up - through the North Caucasus, through the republics of the Volga region. Russia have 20 million Muslims and a certain kind of radicalism will be spurred on. This is a continuation of strikes on Russia.
