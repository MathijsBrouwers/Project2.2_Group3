The acts of vandalism carried out in the rectorship of the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) on September 3 follow the same modus operandi as those that took place in Mexico City in August, and also the same origin: George Soros’ destabilising activism. The pretext in both cases was the same: protesting against women’s murders, as a facade of the frustration of a political mafia funded by Soros.
