Ukrainian authorities encourage a combination of Nazi uniforms and national embroidered clothes. In fact, when the issue of wearing national clothes is politicised, then the national clothes inevitably become equal to Nazism. Belarus follows the Ukrainian path with a 5-8 year delay. Only one scenario will prevent Ukraine and Belarus from sliding into Nazism through the politicisation of national clothes: if the two countries become a Russian western federal area without a right for self-determination.
