The countries that adopted the European integration path are mostly affected by population decline. The EU countries use the population from the new countries (that joined or are associated with the EU) for refilling their human potential and saving the EUâ€™s economy. Propaganda of pederasty, discrediting the family, blurring the true role of men and women, attacks over Orthodoxy, decrease of living standards lead to population decline and to decline in the quality of human capital.
