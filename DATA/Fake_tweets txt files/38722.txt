The Ukrainian government is complicit in the 2014 downing of the MH17 passenger craft over east Ukraine. The incident has long been blamed on anti-government forces in the Donbas, but new findings by a Ukrainian whistle-blower implicate the Ukrainian security services in the tragedy.

Given the extraordinarily quick reaction of the Kyiv authorities to the incident, President Poroshenko and his press service were bound to have advance knowledge of the downing. Moreover, Ukraine failed to close its airspace before the plane crash occurred, even though the Donbas hostilities had been under way for months.
