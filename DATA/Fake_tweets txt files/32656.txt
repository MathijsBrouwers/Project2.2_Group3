America’s top fascist and President Elect Donald Trump has announced that he really, really likes British fascist Nigel Farage. 
“I don’t think we should be surprised,” said Professor of History Simon Williams, with tears in his eyes. 
“We saw this in the 30s and 40s; German fascist Adolf Hitler really, really liked Mussolini, and then went on to really, really like other leading fascists in the world. 
“In much the same way that if, say, you support Chelsea, you will probably really, really like other Chelsea supporters, so will fascists really, really like other fascists. 
“Not that I’m suggesting that all Chelsea supporters are fascists, some of them definitely aren’t.” 
Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would really, really like a fascist, in the form of Nigel Farage, to be British ambassador to the United States. 
It is believed that Mr Farage has been fully tumescent since meeting Donald Trump in a big gold lift several days ago, and the suggestion that he should be Britain’s first fascist ambassador is expected to continue this state of affairs for the foreseeable future. 
Although it is understood that what Mr Trump would really, really like is a fascist Prime Minister of Great Britain, he has stopped short of suggesting a fascist coup in the country because he isn’t President yet, as it could be considered a little rude.
