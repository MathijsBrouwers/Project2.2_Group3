UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently stated that that Russia runs a global campaign of cyber warfare to target foreign governments. It is only the latest in a long string of unsubstantiated allegations which Western officials have made against Moscow.

These include the Kremlin's supposed election interference in the US and elsewhere, as well as a leading role in the Skripal poisoning. But now this "Russia Gate" has collapsed, thanks to the Mueller report, which found no conclusive proof of Russian interference. No evidence has been presented to support either of these claims.
