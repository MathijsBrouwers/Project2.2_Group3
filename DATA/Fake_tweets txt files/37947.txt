The "evidence" demonstrated by the JIT actually ties the missile to Ukraine. In Russia, a missile produced in 1986 would have been decommissioned in 2011. This individual missile was sent to a air-defence unit in Ukraine in 1986, the 223 air-defence brigade. In 2014 it was involved in the war in Donbas.
