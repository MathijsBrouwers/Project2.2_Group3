Missing California Mother Found Safe On Thanksgiving Day 3.8K shares by Ike Mclean / November 25, 2016 / LIFE / 
A 34-year-old mother of two who vanished on November 2 while out jogging near her home in Northern California has been found alive and safe, the Shasta County Sheriff’s Department said Thursday. 
Sherri Papini reappeared on Thanksgiving morning approximately 150 miles away from her house after she flagged down a car on I-5 near Sacramento. 
“She is safe, in stable condition, and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital. She has been reunited with her husband,” said Sheriff Tom Bosenko. 
Police are now actively searching for two Hispanic women armed with handguns and a dark SUV in connection to the kidnapping. There is no known motive in the case, authorities said on Thursday. 
An iPhone, a pair of earbuds and a few strands of what was believed to be her hair were the only leads found on a jogging trail close to the Papini’s home when she went missing, CNN reported. 
Sherri’s husband Keith noticed something was wrong when he arrived home, things were quiet, and his wife and two kids were not there. 
“On normal days, I would open the door and my family comes, runs and gives me a hug,” he told KRCR-TV . 
Keith called the day care center they leave their children at and was told his 2 and 4 year old kids were not picked up yet. He then tracked his wife’s Iphone, found it was down the street, and told the news station “That’s when I knew she had been taken or abducted, in my opinion.” 
An anonymous donor had offered a $50,000 ransom to her captor for her safe return. The amount was raised to $100,000 and then withdrawn a day before she reappeared, DailyMail reported.
