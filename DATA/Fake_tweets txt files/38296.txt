About 3 million Afghan refugees are stuck in Iran. Tehran with the great effort delays them, not allowing to continue their way further to Germany or France. If the Afghans succeed in entering Europe, Germany will be doomed. There are already more than 4 million refugees (mainly from Syria). And France is not in the best shape although there are not so many migrants there.But the situation in North Africa shows that Paris will still be weeping because of this problem.
