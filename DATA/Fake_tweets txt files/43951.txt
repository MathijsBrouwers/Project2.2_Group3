Russian Ministry of Defence: Putin ordered his minister of defence to prepare Syria to become an „impenetrable zone of conflict”, which would become „Obama´s cemetery” and signalled the end of the NATO alliance against Russian federation. This order was secured by an agreement of Putin and Israeli PM Netanyahu that Israel will not intervene with Russian air and ground operations in Syria even in the case of a war with NATO.
