Julian Assange unequivocally denies any involvement from the Russian government in Wikileaks’ release of now almost 45,000 hacked emails from Clinton Campaign staff in a recent interview that will be broadcast on RT .
“I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person,” said Assange.
He went on to explain that Hillary Clinton has been making “neo-McCarthyist” accusations about the Russian government involvement in the email hack without any evidence:
The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That’s false – we can say that the Russian government is not the source. 
Hillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick – for example faint – as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.
