Irving, TX – An intelligent and talented 9th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school. 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices. He can even repair his own go-kart. 
Recently, he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers. Sadly, instead of celebrating his achievement, one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb. 
When the police arrived, they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well, even though it obviously wasn’t. Eventually, the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb, even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock, and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it. 
The young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center, and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room. He was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of. 
“Here in high school, none of the teachers know what I can do,” Ahmed told Dallas News after the incident. 
He then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created, he was warned not to show it to the other teachers. 
“He was like, ‘That’s really nice, I would advise you not to show any other teachers’,” Ahmed said. 
He then kept the clock in his bag until his English class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher. After the class, Ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise, and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school. 
“She was like, it looks like a bomb,” he said. 
“I told her, ‘It doesn’t look like a bomb to me,’” he explained. 
The teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it. However, towards the end of the day, Ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers. 
He said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb. 
“They were like, ‘So you tried to make a bomb? ’” Ahmed said. 
“I told them no, I was trying to make a clock.” 
The officer then told him, “ ‘It looks like a movie bomb to me.’” 
The police even admit that Ahmed never once said the device was a bomb, and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one, but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something, even though they didn’t have any proof. 
“We have no information that he claimed it was a bomb. He kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation,” police spokesman James McLellan said. 
“It could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car. The concern was, what was this thing built for? Do we take him into custody?” he added. 
They couldn’t possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers. 
“They thought, ‘How could someone like this build something like this unless it’s a threat?’,” Ahmed said. 
Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against. 
“He just wants to invent good things for mankind, but because his name is Mohamed and because of Sept. 11, I think my son got mistreated,” he said. 
There has since been an outpour of support on social media since Ahmed’s story went public. He has even gotten support from Mark Z and President Obama. Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.

I did that. As a Vietnam Vet who spent a great deal of time in the Philippines when they were under martial law, life, liberty, and public safety are too precious to let slip. Every time a citizen is persecuted, the Terrorists win. That is the point of terrorism. Destruction alone is not the object. Having us turn on each other is. A draconian law enforcement suits the political purposes by creating innocent martyrs. When they violate the laws they are paid to enforce and threaten the public safety they are sworn to protect, we lose our liberty and the TERRORISTS win. John Lloyd Scharf

It’s not the kid’s fault or the cops, I believe it’s hollywood and the media creating a string of stereotypical “racism” in our minds, we see muslim we think terrorism, the cop only acted on basic instinct I believe it would be smart to start a project putting an end to stereotypes. There exists a possibility it might work. Just thinking away Miguel Angel Coria 
I’m assuming your african american because i actually went into your page, took time to form an idea before I got offended, but just from your comments i’m realizing your just as ignorant as rednecks. People who realize they can’t win in an intellectual debate do they directly start offending their opponent, you might as well start wearing a Donald Trump shirt and watching duck dynasty. Because the problem is that Government separates people by race, religion, or beliefs. They way they can’t stand together against them. Try researching information before going and thinking your right about everything you say. I’m Douglas Brigham 
Cops fuck up its not the cops fault. 
I guess it’s also not Dylan Roof fault that he killed 9 people. Because of the media.

I’m Canadian and love all you. Obama is obviously trying to switch over the American people brain washing from hating Muslim to loving them cos Obama knows he’s killing all thses people over seas to get the oil to feed the industrial military war machine. 
I’m reading an article, generating my own thought about it and creating an idea that might help solve the issue ? And what are you doing about it? Small minded people discuss other people. Average minded people discuss events, Critical thinkers discuss ideas. Aimee Hernandez 
Miguel your initial comment is very basic n ambiguous. You appear to contradict yourself to say the least. What “idea” are you creating to solve the issue? Perhaps you should take a couple steps back, not just one, but a couple sir. I can construe an opinion based on the few comments you have posted. FYI you can’t be part of the solution when your basic mentality is part of the issue. With all due respect read some more….a lot more then pretend to have some sort of “intellictual” debate. Just saying … Miguel Angel Coria 
I’ll leave it plain and simple so you and your friend can understand, I stated my opinion, and an idea (Not the exact blue print). I never stated any of those as a fact. I try and help by spreading thought process but it’s people like you and your friend who go around acting like overseers deciding what is wrong and what is right. I read, I watch, I think. I don’t offend people directly or insult people who try and improve and give opinion. So re-read the post and all it’s comments think about it for a second and just like in elementary school if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything. Go to your hompage and on will find a tab that say’s “what’s on your mind today” go ahead click and go crazy. Have a great day ma’am Miguel Angel Coria

Of course not. How could I? I only spent 18 years in the public school system. I completed an apprenticeship and proceeded to teach up to five people at a time during the work week. As for police. Again how could I? I’ve only spent 31 years being surrounded by them and having them in my family. Lady, before you accuse someone of not knowing what they’re talking about. Make sure that you actually do. Keith Buck

“Looks like a movie bomb to me.”

Hollywood obviously messed up his rational thinking…

Back when I was growing up science fair and art fair projects were encouraged. In high school I had students left and right along with some teachers ask me to fix their Walkman or boombox radio. It was a big boost to my self esteem in the work force.More came with experience. The teachers who had this boy arrested or in no way teachers anymore after the trauma they put him through.
