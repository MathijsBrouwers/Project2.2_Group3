One of the pieces of evidence the investigation team invoked was the missile's serial number. According to the JIT, this serial number says this missile "was made in Moscow in 1986."
It should be noted here that 1986 was the last year of production of the original 9М38, according to a 2015 interview with the manufacturer, Almaz-Antey. The company said at the time that the missile was taken out of service in Russia in 2011, replaced by a newer M1 modification, the 9M38M1.
The original 9M38 missile, however, is still being used in Ukraine, Georgia and Egypt.

The company's simulated explosion experiment resulted in different conclusions than the JIT investigation: it found that the missile that shot down the plane was not a 9M38M1 and that the missile was not fired from the town of Snezhnoye.
According to Almaz-Antey, the JIT also twisted or ignored information presented by the company during the investigation, including the report on the test fire experiment — this, despite the fact that technical documentation regarding the 9M38 and its 9M38M1 modification was declassified specifically for this investigation.
