The United States of America and US Ambassador to Chisinau, Dereck J. Hogan, are interfering in the parliamentary elections in Moldova.

As soon as he took office last autumn, Hogan began to be actively involved in the internal processes of the Republic of Moldova. He publicly supported some politicians over others, offering recommendations on the conduct of parliamentary elections.

The US ambassador's non-diplomatic manners clearly reflect US habits, combining threats with promises and imposing their will. Moldova should not become another area for such irresponsible experiments that destroyed Iraq and Libya, and threw Syria and Ukraine into the abyss of bloody conflicts.
