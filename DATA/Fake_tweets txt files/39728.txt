The Russian Reconciliation Center said that the Islamic State took chemical weapons originating in the West in an attack against Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham near the border of the Idlib Governorate. Allegedly, attackers seized two chlorine canisters. The canisters fell into IS's hands because of the "West's irresponsible behaviour."

A chemical attack was being faked and filmed, and then those videos would be shared with international organisations.
