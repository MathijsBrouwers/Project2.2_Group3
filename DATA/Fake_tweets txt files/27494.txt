Toddlers become spherical for winter 10-11-16 
TODDLERS have expanded into their spherical outdoor forms for the winter months. 
Children aged two to four, who usually resemble humans on a smaller scale, protect themselves from harm in winter by becoming perfectly round and rollable. 
Paediatrician Dr Carolyn Ryan said: “It’s a protection mechanism which both insulates them from the cold and prevents any injuries from slipping on ice. 
“Their stubby legs still protrude from the bottom so they can waddle along and their hands can still just about clutch a plastic dinosaur, but otherwise they’re perfect spheres until the onset of spring.” 
Father-of-two Martin Bishop said: “It’s one of those little things nobody tells you about being a parent but which seems completely obvious once you are. 
“And it’s a massive timesaver on the nursery run because instead of trudging you can just bowl them along at quite a pace. 
“Shit, I didn’t notice the hill.”
