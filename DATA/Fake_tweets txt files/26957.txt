VIDEOS Fake news site CNN completely misrepresents quote, rest of lying media runs with it The whole freak out over “fake news” is nothing more than an excuse for these fake news propagandists to censor their competition 
From The Daily Caller : CNN made a false claim Monday afternoon and various journalists ran wild with it. It all started with a segment on CNN’s The Lead which quoted prominent white nationalist figure Richard Spencer as wondering if Jews were actually people. CNN host Jim Sciutto said, “of Jews Spencer said, ‘one wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem.’” “That is an alt right leader Richard Spencer talking about Jews,” Sciutto added. CNN then had a panel with RealClearPolitics’ Rebecca Berg and The Boston Globe’s Matt Viser with the chyron “ALT-RIGHT FOUNDER QUESTIONS IF JEWS ARE PEOPLE.” Except, Spencer did not make those remarks about Jews and was instead talking about political consultants on television.
