Western media describe Russia is a danger to Western “liberal democracy”. But the West puts all efforts in degrading and discrediting traditional values, the deliberate rejection of these values and the transition to fictional, unstable and malignant structures, pseudo-values, which endanger society. The Russian system of values, although different from the Western one, is something that should be sought. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the right-wing parties in the West want to cooperate with Russia.
