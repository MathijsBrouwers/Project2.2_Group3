Donald Trump is desperate, so he propped his supermodel wife up on stage again and made her give another campaign speech. Apparently, he learned nothing from the last time. Not only did Melania Trump plagiarize her speech again , this time borrowing the words of Donald’s second wife, Marla Maples, but she also seemed to forget who the heck she is married to. 
Speaking to the crowd at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, Melania expanded on her plan to fight online bullying as First Lady. 
“I will be an advocate for women and for children,” she said. “Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence.” 
She then said that many comments, which are “mean and too rough,” come from people with “no name hiding on the Internet.” 
“We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other,” she said. 
“We must come together together as Americans,” she added. “We must treat each other with respect and kindness even when we disagree.” 
Ummm, lady, have you looked at the orange guy that put a ring on your finger? You have a child with him, so you have obviously met the man, right? How do you not seem to realize that you are married to the biggest cyber bully around? Do you not follow him on Twitter? Seriously, WTF? 
Melania needs to take a look at the list of almost 300 people, places, and things Donald has insulted on Twitter since he announced his candidacy.
