The President of the Association of Psychiatrists of Ukraine, Semen Gluzman, states that the massive failure of Ukrainian parents to vaccinate their children led to a large-scale problem with infectious diseases, in particular, measles. He believes that a measles outbreak threatens Ukraine with the loss of a visa-free regime from a number of EU countries.
