Thursday 10 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Alan Sugar considering his options 
Following former ‘ The Apprentice ’ host Donald Trump’s triumph in the US Presidential race, current UK ‘ The Apprentice ’ host Alan Sugar is said to be considering his options. 
“I don’t think it had ever occurred to Lord Sugar that running for office would be an option,” said a friend of the business magnate. 
“Largely because, having no political experience or knowledge of what it takes to run a country, it would be an incredibly stupid, terrifying and dangerous idea. 
“However, being a stupid, terrifying and dangerous idea doesn’t seem a barrier to holding high office anymore, so he is giving the option consideration.” 
It seems that Lord Sugar isn’t the only reality star who is considering a political career. 
“Yeah, what I think is that, you know, I might be a Prime Minister and everything,” said terrifyingly breasted ‘author’ Jordan. 
“I mean, I’m a successful businesswoman, and I’ve been on telly a lot, you know, like Mr Trump, so why not?” 
The British people appear to be reacting warmly to the idea. 
“Well, as a voter, I’m obviously colossally f**king stupid,” said Simon Williams. 
“So I definitely think that voting the presenter of The Apprentice in as leader of my country would be a completely genius idea.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently
