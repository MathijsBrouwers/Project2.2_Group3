The essence of the EU's Eastern Partnership programme is to make its non-EU member states follow Brusselsâ€™ instructions on domestic policies and to go further away from Russia in their external relations. Closer economic cooperation with the EU for non-EU countries is only possible in exchange for political concessions. The reason behind the EU's invitations to the Belarusian president, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, to the EaP summits were to have his signature on a joint anti-Russian declaration. Politically, the EU's aim behind the Eastern Partnership is to isolate Moscow. Therefore, Belarus' position to develop ties with both the EU and Russia is irrelevant for the EU.
