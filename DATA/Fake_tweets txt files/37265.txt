Tensions since the end of the USSR come from Moscow. It is the United States that are literally colonising Poland.
Everyone knows geography. There is natural gas that costs less. Yet the Poles - for some reason - buy the gas ten times farther than where it is produced in an abominably anti-ecological way in the United States and which is much more expensive. They are literally forced to buy American equipment. There is also an over-presence of US military forces. The Poles, unfortunately for them, were under Soviet influence and now they are under the influence of the United States.
