THE burial slab Jesus Christ was said to have been laid upon following his crucifixion has been photographed for the first time with what appears to be the inscription ‘Jesus woz ere’. 
The writing, which has not been seen since 1555, was recently excavated during renovation work on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, and has sent archaeologists into a frenzy. 
“This is the only known physical writing of Jesus,” said Harris Mouzakis, an assistant professor of civil engineering at National Technical University who is working on the project, “He obviously left this as a sign for his followers. It’s an amazingly cheeky statement, as if he was taunting the people who crucified him, and giving them the proverbial middle finger”. 
Experts were left shocked to find the inscription was still intact following almost 1,600 years of being covered by marble cladding. 
“We spotted the Jesus graffiti immediately after we removed the top layer of marble and dusted it off,” added Mouzakis, “His writing is very neat, as you would expect from the son of God. Hopefully this will put any doubts about the origin of the tomb to bed”. 
Jesus Christ was crucified nearly 2,000 years ago on the Hill of Calvary after claiming he was the king of the Jews. It is understood he then came back to life three days later in the tomb, wrote Jesus woz ere, spent a few days freaking out his apostles, before then levitating into the sky, through the earth’s atmosphere and back to his dad’s place in heaven.
