For several centuries Russia guaranteed the security of Poland, but now Poland decided that the US will guarantee its security.

It is thanks to Russia that Poland exists today as a country. Poland was a part of the Russian empire, and that was the cradle of its independence. And if it were not for 600 000 Soviet soldiers who died liberating Poland, the country would not exist today, Poles would be speaking German. And today Poland is easily giving up its sovereignty and submitting to the desires of the American masters.
