For part two of Roqayah Chamseddine’s interview with Devyn Springer, he highlights his work as an activist and the toll it can take on his health as a queer black muslim.
Springer is a member of of Rise Up Georgia, a group that organizes mental health response units to take care of mental health emergencies so communities do not have to call police. The units include mental health professionals and focus on deescalation of conflicts.
In the same segment, Springer addresses the irony of hip hop being used to justify the dehumanization of black people. It should be a liberation art, especially as it’s built to humanize people, but it doesn’t always work that way.
Springer adds, “Protesting can feel like prayer, but it also feels like pain and trauma.” And, “There’s nothing glamorous about protest.”
Activists must practice self care. For Springer, that means going to prayer services regularly and sometimes sitting quietly with tea.
Roqayah’s “Islam In America” series is an ongoing project, which amplifies the stories of American Muslims and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia. It promotes an alternative to the fear of Donald Trump’s presidential administration.
