A desperate attempt to seize power by a pro-American minority is driven by cynical rational, experts say. Bolivia possesses the largest lithium deposits in the world. A growing production of batteries and electric cars instigates an increased demand for lithium on the world market. In early November, the Bolivian authorities refused to cooperate with the Germans on lithium extraction. Instead, the Chinese and Russians could be involved in cooperation with Bolivia in this sphere. This is just a business: the US-educated Bolivian military is shooting civilians who protest against the preservation of power by the pro-US government. It is unlikely, however, that the interim government and their US patrons will swallow Bolivia so easily. The county is on the edge of civil war and chaos.
