For those who have yet to vote, please do not add to the corruption inside of government by voting for a sleazy woman under federal investigation. 
She has too much baggage. 
Our country will spend all it’s energy on her issues and scandals and once again, get NOTHING done for the American people. Looks like a lot of Hillary voters are regretting their choice.  #VoteTrump #TrumpPence16 pic.twitter.com/tIyGbOHJGl
