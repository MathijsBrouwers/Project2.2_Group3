G7 is not an international organisation. It has no charter or any kind of fundamental principles. It is not even a elite club. G7 is a mouthpiece of the Trilateral Commission. G7 convenes annually, some times after the Trilateral Commission's annual convention.The Trilateral Commission is an attempt to unite Anglo-Saxons, Europeans and the Japanese. The decisions, taken in the Trilateral Commission behind the veils, are made public by the G7. This demonstrates the Western leaders' role as marionettes; they are merely dancing according to the music of the conceptual centres in the shadows.
