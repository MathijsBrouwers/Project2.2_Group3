Claims presented by Ukraine to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea concerning the countryâ€™s rights to the Kerch strait are completely inappropriate. Questions of sovereignty over the Crimea as an integral part of the Russian Federation and the adjacent maritime zone, in principle, can not be the subject of any legal proceedings.
