David Duke October 29, 2016 
Today Dr. Duke and Professor Kevin MacDonald talked about the tide turning in Donald Trumpâs direction. In spite of the efforts by the Zio media to divert voter attention to Donald Trumpâs alleged problems with women, Hillaryâs treasonous crimes are increasingly difficult to hide. 
The fact is that Hillary should be prosecuted, not inaugurated. She has supported ISIS in its war against Syria its terrorism against America. She has sent paid thugs to disrupt Trumpâs political events. She has used her government positions to peddal influence. She really should be in prison. 
This is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.
