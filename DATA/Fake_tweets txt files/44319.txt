Most of the leading US media have spent the last three years promoting the infamous Russiagate conspiracy theory on behalf of the Democrats, refusing to admit that they were wrong, though Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, during a two-year investigation, failed to find anything that would incriminate the US president.

There is a whole history of leaking information from the intelligence community in order to "forge a false link" between Trump and Russia and further the "Russiagate" narrative, and then blame Trump for the "vulnerability" of these alleged sources.
