I was particularly impressed by the visit to the village of Zaitseve. You know, there's a war going on there. And there is a war not against the Russian Army, but against the children and civilians of this village. There are 1,200 people in the village of Zaitsevo now. And there are 200 children among them. And just 300 meters to the front line. And with me visiting it, the shelling occurred there. There were shelling on civilians. And we did not see any soldiers or Russian tanks, which are being reported about always and everywhere by Ukraine.
