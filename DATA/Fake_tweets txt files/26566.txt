Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for strictly obeying set safety measures to avoid dangerous incidents involving military aircraft and ships, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Oct. 28. 
"Unconditionally, the president does not support fanning any tensions," Peskov stated. "He urges strict observance of the existing regulations in international law, which define cooperation in the context of avoiding dangerous incidents - both in the skies and at sea." 
Along with this, Peskov neither confirmed, nor denied media reports that at one of the meetings, Putin had allegedly harshly responded to an incident when Russian jets flew close to a U.S. warship. 
"Closed-door meetings are held so that opinions could be exchanged there freely," the spokesman emphasized.
