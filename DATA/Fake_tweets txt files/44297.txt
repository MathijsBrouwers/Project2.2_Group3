The US told Russia that the Aegis system could not be used for medium-range land-based missiles. The Aegis was already in Europe and prepared for Romania and Poland.

Russia was told: 'It cannot be used for medium-range land-based missiles'.

And then the US burst the bomb and announced that the Aegis system could be used to launch these medium-range missiles. At least they could take a longer break, after the withdrawal from the INF Treaty.

It is clear that Russia was deceived. The US tried to deceive us, and now the US just admitted it.
