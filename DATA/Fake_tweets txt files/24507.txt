So this is new. 
Via the Financial Times , New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet is coming out hot against CNN and Fox News: 
“This mix of entertainment and news, and news masquerading as entertainment, is kind of funny except that we now have a guy who is a product of that world nominated as Republican presidential nominee." 
Politico noted that Baquet also called out CNN for hiring Corey Lewandowski, and called Fox News “not a journalistic institution” at heart. He did compliment Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace, calling them great journalists. 
Earlier this week, the Times published a major story detailing Trump's Twitter insults, which are also available on Twitter: Get the magnifying glass: 2 full pages in 3-pt type of NYT listing hundreds of Trump's insults pic.twitter.com/AylrTa2ScJ — Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) October 24, 2016 
Not to be deterred, Baquet also dropped a fun burn, claiming cable news coverage in 2016 has been: 
“bad for democracy and those institutions.” 
Ouch!
