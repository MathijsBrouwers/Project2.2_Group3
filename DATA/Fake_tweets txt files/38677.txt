The Belarusian opposition is secretly managed by Western institutions, politicians and West-linked NGOs (funded by USAID). Their strategic aim is to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.

US, Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries are most active in this regard.

Over the last years, the West has been using Ukraine to pressure Belarus more often than before. Ukraine's role within the broader Western strategy against Belarus is to organise information provocations, to give military training to Belarusian radicals, to support public protests with arms, and to organize breakthroughs to Belarus by groups of Ukrainian militants.
