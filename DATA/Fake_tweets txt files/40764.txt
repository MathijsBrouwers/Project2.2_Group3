The results of the vote in PACE demonstrate the abolition of sanctions imposed on Russia, as “the Resolution prohibits the OSCE to extend the term of the restrictions imposed on Russia without the consent of the member states”. This makes the possibility of extension of the sanctions against Russia questionable, therefore the sanctions could be lifted in January of the next year.
