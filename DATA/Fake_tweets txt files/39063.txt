The Skripal poisoning was a strategic operation of the British special services. It was executed by British intelligence agency MI6, but was actually planned by the US. The operation was designed to have three distinct phases: the first began in March 2018, the second in the autumn of 2018, and the third and final stage will commence soon, with the announcement of Sergei Skripal's death.
