Most of Hollywood has been silent about Hillary Clinton’s many criminal charges, but American idol Dolly Parton is refusing to stay silent on the issue . 
Parton started out as a supporter of Clinton. 
“We’re doing good,” she commented during an interview. “We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.” 
It didn’t take long for Parton to change her mind about the Democratic presidential nominee and recognize her for the manipulative, deceitful criminal she really is. 
In a more recent interview, Parton called Hillary “nuts” and claimed that her campaign has “just crazy.” 
She then urged the American public to stop being fooled by Hillary. 
“Let’s talk about what we really need—taking care of us,” Parton continued. “I think people just want to have a feeling of security. It’s just like political terrorism right now. We’ve got room for improvement.”
