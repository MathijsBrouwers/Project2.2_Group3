It is too early to rule out "natural causes" for the fire at Notre Dame of Paris, but it is possible that the cathedral was set ablaze either by the Yellow Vests as an attack on Macron, or by Islamist extremists. Even if the Islamist are not responsible for the fire, the very fact that some young supporters of radical Islam has expressed joy about this event is horrible. The fire from Notre Dame will set all of Europe on fire.
