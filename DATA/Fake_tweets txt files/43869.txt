The Americans built a military base in North Macedonia two years ago. It is one among 1,500 military bases in the world, and was made without an agreement between states but with a deal with just one or two Macedonian politicians. Two years ago, the US army came here and built a drone aircraft runway for their base. The purpose was to enable attacks with the most deadly drones for the purposes of the Americans and NATO in the fights against terrorism in the Middle East or the countries in Africa. Now, with this arrangement, foreign soldiers operating in the base are protected with special laws and the host country has no jurisdiction in punishing them and they are free to commit crimes and genocides. For example, these foreign soldiers can murder and rape, and there will be no legal consequences.
