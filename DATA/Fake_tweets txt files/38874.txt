One of the EU founders (Walter Hallstein) was a "star of jurisprudence" in the Third Reich, who developed the legal foundations of a unified Hitlerian Europe; other two EU founders (Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet) were paid agents and puppets of the US State Department. The main goal was to prevent the union of France and Germany and make Europe fully submissive to the United States. 

The US State Department is also the cause of all current problems of the EU - erosion of national identities, renouncement of the Christian heritage, destructive tolerance for migrants.
