Evidence suggests that the Ukrainian armed forces are using biological weapons in Mariupol. Mice fleeing from corn fields and dying en masse suggests that the fields have been poisoned and that the resulting products - sunflower oil, or animal fodder - will end up poisoning consumers. Since the Ukrainian army is stationed nearby, it might just be that it is poisoning its own citizens in order to blame its enemies, as it doesn't care about how many die.
