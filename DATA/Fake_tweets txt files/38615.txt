NATO was built upon a set of lies, such as an alleged expansion of Soviet communism. This was never true. As NATO expanded in the Eastern Europe, despite promises given to Moscow, Russia found out that it was in an existential danger. Any systematic concession to Western powers would mean the disappearance of Russia as a united state, the deprivation of its natural resources, not to say the destruction of its own population. Now NATO is focusing on its expansion in Latin America since the block needs the support of other governments in other continents to expand its networks and influences.
