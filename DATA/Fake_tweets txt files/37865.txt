Bearing in mind that Americans are performing inspections at the Ukrainian front-line more and more often, a set-up is very much likely, where someone from a Nato delegation is killed. That would be organised as a "involvement of a third party" or just a shooting, where the blame will be put on the home-guard of Donbas. After all, would Pentagon really hesitate to kill a colonel or diplomat or two in order to instigate a war?

The well-oiled machinery of Western propaganda would spring into action immediately and blame the home-guard of Donbas or directly on Russia. Then the cannons will start talking. It's a hard-working system, applied many times; for instance in former Yugoslavia. The concept of setting up the death of NATO representatives is, according to rumours from the Ukrainian ministry of defence, already discussed.
