Katheryn From My Walk & Talk 6 shares by DML DAILY / November 25, 2016 / LIFE / 
On my Walk & Talk on Friday, I told the story about Katheryn. She was just 50 years old when she was informed that she was dying of colon cancer. This is the video of me taking her to the Montauk Lighthouse before she died. It was the one last place she wanted to visit. 
The video clip is from 2009. Below is the Walk & Talk from today 11/15. Go towards the end, I tell the story of Katheryn.
