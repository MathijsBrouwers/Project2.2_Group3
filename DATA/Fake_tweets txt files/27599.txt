Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Mikhail Saakashvili’s governorship of Odessa was an insult to the Ukrainian people. 
"This was simply a slap and insult to Odessans and the whole Ukrainian people. He couldn’t even get a working visa to the US and the universities he tried to find work at didn’t want to employ him in a permanent job. This means that he can’t fulfill the duties of being the governor of Odessa. And what, are there no decent, professional, and capable Ukrainians for such a job?”, Putin said in an interview with Oliver Stone for the documentary “Ukraine in Flames.” 

In early November, Saakashvili announced his intention to resign from the post of governor of the Odessa region over the unwillingness of Ukrainian authorities to fight against corruption. He also blamed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for patronizing criminal clans in the region.
