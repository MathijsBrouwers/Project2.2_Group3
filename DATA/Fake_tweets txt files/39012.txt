The US is attempting to split Syria and create a quasi-state on the east bank of the Euphrates River because Washington opposes the return of Syria's north-east to the Syrian government. US plans to transfer control in Syria's buffer zone are illegitimate. Also, Washington prohibits its allies from investing in the redevelopment of other liberated parts of Syria, now controlled by the Syrian government.
