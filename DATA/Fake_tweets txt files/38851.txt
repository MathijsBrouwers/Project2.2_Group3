In Sweden, a film about a Russian military attack on the country has premiered. A film like that has only one objective: to scare the Swedes and convince them that Russia is a monster, prepared to use chemical and biological weapons. Swedes are supposed to feel the threat from Russia. All this is to prepare the Swedes for a NATO membership.
