“Do not try to criticize” if you dont know the subject very well! This advise is from one of India’s prominent economist S Gurumurthy. This is equally applicable to all of us because, recently all the social media discussions are totally focusing on currency demonetization and interestingly everybody has become an economist! 
This video is specially dedicated to all those Facebook Economist who think that Demonetisation is a joke. Listen to learn How massive this mission is and How secretly it gets implemented. Gurumurthy explains Why it couldn’t be implemented better. 
We are also dedicating this to our Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banarjee of West Bengal. These two have gone completely crazy after the demonetization announcement. We dont need to discuss about the reason behind their panic as it is no loner a secret! 1.8k
