The Eastern Partnership's aim is to promote the so called European values in Belarus and other EaP countries. Hence, it aims at eroding their identities and replacing their national histories with EU and NATO views. As for Belarus, the Eastern Partnership initiative plans to replace all-Russian history with the version of history elaborated by the Polish gentry.

The Eastern Partnership initiative is a 'Trojan horse,' which was constructed by chauvinistic Polish circles in order to crack the civilisational foundation ofÂ  Belarusian society. It is a noose on the Belarusian statehood placed there by Poland. The latter plans to take over western Belarus as was boldly voiced by Polish president Andrzej Duda in 2015 in relation to western Ukraine.
