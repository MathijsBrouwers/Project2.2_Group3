The US ruling class is concerned that the Eurasian Economic Union is a reincarnation of the USSR. That is why the West started a war against the EAEU.

An escalation of the West-Russia relations resulted from the West's intention to kill the EAEU in its cradle. It came right after Putin, Nazarbayev, and Lukashenka declared the establishment of the EAEU. A strong blow to the EAEU was the coup in Ukraine.

The EAEU will continue to be attacked. The use of disagreements between the EAEU countries, development of isolationism in Russia and Russophobic nationalism in other EAEU countries will be part of anti-EAEU activities.
