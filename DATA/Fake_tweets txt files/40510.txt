There are no reforms there [in Ukraine]! Only the curators of Ukraine -  the Americans and the EU members – have an interest to this stuff. And Poroshenko is providing them with these lies that supposedly something like that is going on. There are no reforms there. There is a robbery and collapse of the country [...]. And everyone knows that.
