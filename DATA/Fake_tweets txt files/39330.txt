New York Times and Washington Post are serving the US military industry, and the American mass media is manipulating President Trump. The media is putting pressure on Trump by attacking him about the deal with the Russians. This is used as an instrument to manipulate him. There must be someone, like a puppet-master, standing behind this press.

The puppet masters revealed themselves after the results of US Presidential election, and when citizens of California declared their ambitions to secede from the United States - the so called Calexit. Trump is challenging the International Business Conglomerates, and they are striking back.

Trump is attacked by the financial corporations of New York and the mass media. Former military generals act as their advisers.
