Today Dr. Duke had radio talk show host Farren Shoaf as his guest for the hour. They went into the various criminal aspects of the revelations about Hillary Clinton. In addition to the outrages of Hillary’s support for ISIS via massive weapons shipments to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Shoaf pointed out that the media failing use the words “obstruction of justice,” which was actually the crime that forced Richard Nixon from the White House. 
Mr. Shoaf also raised the fact that never before has there been a major party candidate for president whose criminality was so obvious BEFORE the election, yet more than 40% of voters appear ready to put her in the oval office.
