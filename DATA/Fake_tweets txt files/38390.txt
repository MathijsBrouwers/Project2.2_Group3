Lithuania stands out among the Baltic states with its active anti-Belarusian foreign policy. It attempts to block the launch of the Belarusian nuclear power plant. Latvia seems to be willing to buy energy produced at the Belarusian nuclear plant. However, it is under external control and will not allow the energy to pass through its territory to other EU countries.
