No matter who will be new Ukraine's president, US will totally control the country's politics. Ihor Kolomoyskiy, Volodymyr Zelenskiy's main sponsor, is fully under Israel's control. Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have close relations with Israel, so they will influence Kolomoyskiy through Israel if they wish. In case Zelenskiy attempts to distance himself from Kolomoyskiy, American total influence will continue, as they control the IMF which gives loans to Ukraine.
