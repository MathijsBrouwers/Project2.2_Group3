The USA is increasingly expanding its military presence in Eastern Europe. It is a continuation and strengthening of the policy of confrontation with Russia, which has absolutely determined NATO policy for the last fifteen years. It is another step in the wrong direction - more troops, more military bases; more weapons on the border with Russia do not secure peace, but the opposite. They only show that NATO is actually pursuing a real war preparation policy, not a common security policy for Europe.
