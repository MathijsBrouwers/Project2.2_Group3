America really, really, really not ready for woman president 09-11-16 THE USA was so unready to have a woman as president that it would vote for literally anyone else instead, it has been confirmed. Following Hillary Clinton’s defeat by a man who has never worked in politics and has no interest in doing so, the glass ceiling has been reinforced with toughened shatterproof safety glass. Wayne Hayes of Jasper, Indiana said: “Boy, were we not ready for a woman president. Not this century. “Commentators were all ‘well we had a black man as president’, but didn’t reckon the most important word there was ‘man’. “Women can’t be trusted. They’re emotional, they think clothes are important, and might try to get revenge for the last 6,000 years. “I believe President Trump should pass a constitutional amendment to make sure no woman embarrasses herself like this ever again. It’d be fairer.” Hillary Clinton agreed: “I should’ve realised it was black man, white man, gay man, white man, black gay man, another 12 white men, then woman.”
