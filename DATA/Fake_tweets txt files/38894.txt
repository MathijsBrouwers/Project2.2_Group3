The creation of a university with Belarusian as the only language of instruction would violate the Belarusian constitution, which guarantees the equal status of the two official languages â€“ Belarusian and Russian.
There are no education institutions in Belarus, neither on pre-school nor on higher education level, with Russian as the only language of instruction.
