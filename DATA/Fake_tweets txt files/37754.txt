Russia's triumphal victory in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics made Americans and their allies worry about the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. They were tempted to use Crimea and Donbas events as a pretext to attack Russia through boycotting the Olympics but eventually decided to act through WADA, accusating Russia of purposeful doping policies. After 2014 a real anti-Russian "cold war" in sport has been waged. This war will be on at least until 2032 whatever the Russian anti-doping agency would do.

WADA's attack has very little to do with combating doping. Instead, it aims at removing Russia as a strong sports competitor, pressing Vladimir Putin and the Russian government by demonstrating their alleged corruption and international isolation to the Russian population, and at humiliating Russia. There's nothing more humiliating than athletes competing without national flag and anthem. Maybe they should also wear a prison uniform or a uniform with yellow stars as poor Jews in Nazi ghetto?

Members of WADA Executive Committee include representatives of the UK, Norway, Slovakia, Belgium, Turkey, Czechia, Italy, Poland, Australia, Sudan, and Ecuador. The representatives of the two latter countries are assigned a rather decorative role, whereas all the others are US allies. The Committee does not include members who have any independence from the US, thus allowing them to solve the problem. Russia should adopt an asymmetric response: to check if Russian law enforcement agencies have anything on the members of the WADA Executive Committee and to think of organizing alternative Olympic Games and World Championships.
