The newest batch of emails released from Wikileaks puts Hillary Clinton in deep trouble. Eric Bolling read them through and through and discovered that Hillary actually has deep terror ties… 
From Conservative 101: 
Eric Bolling and his team took the time to sift carefully through the emails. 
Announced Bolling on The Five , “There are even more ne WikiLeaks revelations. In 2014, Hillary sent an e-mail to her Campaign Chairman John Podesta saying, ‘Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.’ And the leaked e-mails also show Clinton’s staff debated how much outrage she should show lawmakers over Benghazi at her 2015 Capitol Hill hearing. K.G., they have lots — it’s like 4,000 e-mails in the last couple of days.” 
Does it get any more disgusting than this? 
Saudia Arabia gave her personal “charity” the Clinton Foundation $35 million dollars, and now in her emails we have proof she knew Saudi Arabia was funding ISIS. 
There you have it folks. Elic Bolling just exposed everything! 
This is the evidence that the American public needed… this will destroy Hillary for good! 
Share it everywhere, America deserves to know the truth!
