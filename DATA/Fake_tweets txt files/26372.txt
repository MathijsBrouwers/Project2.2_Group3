Men are increasingly turning to virtual assistants to have sexually explicit conversations, it has been claimed. 
Some teenagers and “truckers” who do not have partners are also developing feelings for female and male-voiced chatbots such as Siri , one expert said. 
Ilya Eckstein, the chief executive of Robin Labs, said his company’s virtual assistant – Robin – was used by some men for up to 300 conversations a day. 
He told The Times it was “mostly teenagers and truckers without girlfriends” who were turning to the virtual world. 
“This happens because people are lonely and bored…. It is a symptom of our society,” he said. “As well as the people who want to talk dirty, there are men who want a deeper sort of relationship or companionship.” 
Virtual assistants – such as the iPhone’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana – are included on smartphones and computers to make life easier, allowing users to issue commands, such as “call mum”, or easily search for nearby facilities such as restaurants and petrol stations.
