Since 2014, Ukraine has not paid contributions to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and does not have a representative there, but at the same time retains a number of agreements and participates in the work of industry cooperation bodies.

Representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry declared that the debt of Ukraine to the CIS exceeds 300 million rubles. Kyiv has not yet decided whether to repay the debt.
