NATO exercises in Lithuania, named after a Lithuanian fascist armed group, try to provoke and frighten Russia.

NATO has always known how to "dignify" historical events in an infamous way. Germany had joined NATO on 9 May 1955 - exactly ten years after the Russian day of victory over fascism. Will all right-wing radicals in the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence want to take revenge on Moscow by naming NATO's military exercises after a fascist armed group? No one can tell that this was not meant to be a deliberate provocation.

Germany, along with ten other NATO countries, is also participating in the manoeuvres, which apparently serve to deter Russia in the region.
