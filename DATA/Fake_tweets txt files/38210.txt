The protests against the construction of an Orthodox church in Yekaterinburg follow the same pattern as the Maidan movement in Ukraine. What is described as “popular protests” and the “voice of the people,” is nothing but the voice of the big business. The protests have nothing to do with the protection of ecology and the protection of democratic freedoms in Russia: pure commerce, nothing personal.
