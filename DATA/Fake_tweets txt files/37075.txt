A big Russian civilisation concept envisages neither the change in the status of newly independent states nor the territorial expansion of Russia. Crimea accession to Russia was an exception, aimed to save the peninsula from imminent civil war following the Donbas scenario. As we can see, Kremlin does not intend to join South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Donetsk and Luhansk popular republics.

A big Russian civilization differs from European-Transatlantic one with its eclecticism when it comes to politics and values. Instead, the US and Europe rely on the totalitarian promotion of extended understanding of human rights to the detriment of traditional values. A big Russian civilization also differs from state-controlled Chinese civilization by its level of freedom and openness.
