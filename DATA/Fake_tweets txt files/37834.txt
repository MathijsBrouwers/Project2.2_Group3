The Belarusian opposition views past historical events in a light favourable to both the West and fascism. The ancestors of opposition activists were fascist collaborators during WWII and exterminated civilians. Hence, they have a fierce hatred at the genetic level.

The Belarusian opposition would be much happier if at the anniversary of Nazi Germany's attack on the USSR (June 22nd) people would take to the streets wearing swastikas and shouting "Long live Belarus!" and "Glory to Ukraine!". The opposition would also prefer seeing garrison soldiers wearing LGBT badges. Only in this case would the opposition acknowledge the significance of commemorating WWII history.
