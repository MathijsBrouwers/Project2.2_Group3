Report Copyright Violation If the Christian evangelicals believe Trump will save America then that means he will destroy it instead. These people are always wrong. They supported bush. The patriot act. Torture. The war in Iraq. They demonized anybody who didn't support the war. Called them unpatriotic. These also are the same people who want to bomb Iran because it would bring about the rapture. They told us Obama was the antichrist and would take away your guns but then nothing happened. And they think Putin(Mr. KGB)is a great man. They control hellholes like Mississippi and Alabama(two of the sorriest states in the country).If Trump is Pat Robertson's man you better hope he doesn't get elected. It will be a disaster. No doubt about it. Page 1
