Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, were blessed by Margaret Thatcher to undermine socialism. On CIA instructions Yakovlev chaired the campaign on USSR destruction. His campaign included falsification of the alleged secret protocol to Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Katyn tragedy, both based on Goebbels fakes. Boris Yeltsin, first Russia's president, was a CIA agent too. He appointed CIA officers to each Russian ministry, destroyed Russian industry and agriculture, science, education, and health care system, and inflicted larger damage on Russia than Hitler's or Napoleon's occupations taken together.

Belarusian politician Zianon Pazniak has been a CIA agent too. His mission was to invent the Kurapaty story and to assign the crimes by Hitler's followers to Belarusian people and USSR's NKVD, thus contributing to USSR's destruction. It allowed Americans to benefit thanks to USSR resources and technologies for trillions of US dollars. Present-time impoverished people and great Russian losses are a consequence of Pazniak's activities.
