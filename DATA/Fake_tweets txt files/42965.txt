The Polish role in Maidan was discussed more than once. Warsaw is still playing an active role in the ‘democratisation’ of Ukraine and Belarus: educating opposition politicians, giving away scholarships and Polish cards.

However, notwithstanding the lesson learned in Ukraine, Poland keeps supporting Belarusian nationalists and is preparing the opposition to replace Lukashenko.
