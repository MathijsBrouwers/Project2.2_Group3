Man loves saying things are 'al dente' 02-11-16 A MAN uses the expression ‘al dente’ wherever possible, it has emerged. 25-year-old estate agent Julian Cook uses the term a lot because it makes him feel refined and clever, even if he does not know what it means and just thinks it is a general term for luxury. He said: “This pasta is perfectly al dente. So are the accompanying vegetables. “This glass of wine is al dente too.” Cook has also described his car and his dog as being al dente. His girlfriend Emma Bradford said: “It all started when he seriously undercooked some pasta and I said it was al dente so that he wouldn’t feel bad. I could see from the way he looked at me it was like a lightbulb had gone on in his head. “Last night he told me his wants to start a nightclub called Al Dente. I just said it sounded really good.”
