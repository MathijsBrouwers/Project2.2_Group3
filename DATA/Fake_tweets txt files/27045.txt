If you are in the Lone Star State and not too far from Dallas, we hope you’ll join us for some post-Halloween fun at a meetup next Wednesday, November 2. 
Steve in Dallas has graciously arranged for us to meet at 
Cantina Laredo 4546 Belt Line Rd Dallas, TX 75244 
As you can see, it is just east of Beltline and Midway, on the south side: 
We’ll start at 5:00 PM. I’m sure I’ll be there until at least 8 PM. Steve says he’s hosted many groups there before, so the manager is fine with us not knowing how many people will join. That means you don’t need to worry about there being enough room for everyone if we have the high class problem of really good turnout. 
In all the meetups, readers have really enjoyed getting to chat with other members of the community, so I’m looking forward to another fun event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed). See you soon! 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Notices on
