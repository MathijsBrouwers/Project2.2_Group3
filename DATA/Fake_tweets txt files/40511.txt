We [Russia] saved humanity [from Nazism during World War II] and humanity as a matter of fact owes us, although we do not demand a debt from it, but it owes us. And because of this, any things that Europe is doing today - at the Olympics, in Ukraine, anywhere, the sanctions. Here, given this debt, it would be difficult for them [to recognize Russia's leading role in the victory over Nazism]. Now, this debt must be wiped, it is necessary to grade and minimise it somehow because then it will be easier for them to act meanly and introduce double standards, it will be easier to pretend that we are subhuman.
