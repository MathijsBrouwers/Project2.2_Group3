Baltic experts have come to the conclusion that the only way out of the demographic catastrophe of the Baltic States will be the immigration from tropical Africa. This means a demographic surrender: Baltic States recognize that Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians cannot be saved from extinction and that the only way to stop depopulation of the Baltic States is foreign migrants.

So far the Baltic states cover their demographic shame with impoverished Ukrainians who are fleeing the "European choice" of Ukraine. However, the real fun for theÂ  Baltic states' authorities will start when people born in Congo, Zimbabwe, and Equatorial Guinea will become new Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. After it happens, one will be able to laugh as the Baltic states finally get what they deserve.
