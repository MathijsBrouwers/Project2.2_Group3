Russians in the post-Soviet countries have become hostages of local ethnocracies. Russian ethnic regions were mostly developed by Russians. Thanks to Russians many people of the Russian empire survived and preserved their national identity. But today local nationalists point at Russians as the main source of evil, openly falsify history, attempt to instil a sense of guilt and the feeling of inferiority on them. The brightest example is Ukraine, where the history of WWII is openly rewritten, Nazis and their accomplices are proclaimed heroes, and everything which has to do with the Russian World is discredited. At the same time, the Ukrainian nation itself was created by the Soviet power and the country's infrastructure was mainly developed by Russians.

The same processes, at least covertly, take place in a number of other post-Soviet countries, including in Kazakhstan and Belarus. In the Baltic states, they introduce open bans on the use of Russian, on the right to get the education in Russian, and Russians are perceived as "second-class people", in full accordance with the Third Reich standards. However local political elites are warmly welcomed by the European community. The double standards policy towards Russians has long ago become a business card of the Western elites. For them, Russophobia is often perceived as good manners. Discrimination of Russians in post-Soviet ethnocracies is actively encouraged by the West. Russophobia is turning into a symbol of conformity with the Western system of values and is an important element of the ideological war that the West wages against Russia.
