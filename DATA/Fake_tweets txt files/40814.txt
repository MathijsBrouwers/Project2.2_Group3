The Ukrainian military has already made a number of statements that show Ukraine is forced [by the West, primarily the US] to start a war [against Russia in order to liberate Donbas]. [...] In addition, you have to understand that Saakashvili, who appears to be the future prime minister of Ukraine, is the only politician in the world, who attacked Russia, and he wasnâ€™t punished for that. This is an invaluable resource. If a person attacks once and then he gets away with it, he realises that he can do it again.
