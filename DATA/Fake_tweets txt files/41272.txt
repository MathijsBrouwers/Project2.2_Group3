The biggest sabotage is the story of the Holodomor. The famine is called the Holodomor, and some people continue to replicate this name. The Holodomor means that the people were starved deliberately. Not a single document has been found to prove that people were starved deliberately. It was large-scale sabotage against Ukrainians in the Soviet Union invented in Canada, in the USA, and in Western Ukraine.
