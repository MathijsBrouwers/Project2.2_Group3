Ukraine is imitating political competition along the model of modern Western Europe. But actually there is no political competition. The West will bring Poroshenko to power. In fact all frontrunners in the election would be acceptable for the West, as they would do as they are told. But Poroshenko has advantages, as he has already proven himself. If he wins the elections, it is obvious that it would happen with great violations. Just look at the millions of Ukrainians that cannot vote. These elections have nothing to do with democracy.
