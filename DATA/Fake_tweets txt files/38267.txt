The fire could have been caused by an accident, an Islamist attack or a revenge against Macron from the leftist Yellow vests. In France there are a lot of ultra leftists of all colours, from Trotskyists to anarchists, perhaps this was a planned blow against everything that they hate: religion, state, and Macron as the formal leader.

All this, of course, makes the “Islamist” hypothesis much less probable.
