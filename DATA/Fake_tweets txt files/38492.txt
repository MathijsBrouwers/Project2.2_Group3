Russia bashing takes place in the French press. It has evolved a lot since the 70s and 80s when Franceâ€™s media was pluralistic and discussions between different political figures took place. This is not the case nowadays. Take a random newspaper. Le Monde, for example: It is the Pravda of today. Its coverage of Russia is even worse than Pravda. Every media outlet reports the same. The question is, how has France reached this point?

In Russia, freedom of speech exists but in our own way.

In France, you can only say one thing about Russia, like aggression and that Putin is a dictator. This is freedom to say only one narrative. Let's take coverage of Ukraine in France. It's almost like one centre exists which indicates what to write: a democratic country is struggling against Russian aggression. Only a few media outlets mention that there are far right, Nazi forces in Ukraine which march like the Nazis in Germany in the 30s.
