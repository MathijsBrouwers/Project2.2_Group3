Russia is the only state genuinely interested in Ukraine's integrity. Western countries want Ukraine as a state to disappear. The US was only interested in Crimea as a springboard for US missiles, to create a deadly threat to Russia and Belarus. If Crimea were under the Pentagon's control, the situation in the whole region would change radically for the worse, and provoke Poland's aggression. If Poland wouldn't execute an outright military intervention in Belarus, it would have at least organised a successful coup d'état.
