The destruction of war memorials and graves violates the 1993 treaty between Russia and the Czech Republic. It is especially shameful such things to occur on the basis of a political whim that has nothing whatsoever to do with the past. The aim of the situation with the statue of Marshall Konev is to induce hatred against Russia as part of a war psychosis aimed at provoking aggression against Russia.
