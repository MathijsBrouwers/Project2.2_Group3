In the Czech Republic, there are more than 25,000 Arab migrants living legally. There are two huge gaps in Czech legislation allowing almost uncontrolled migrations of Arabs to the Czech Republic. Legal visas are issued to students and businessmen from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Entrepreneurship brings money, and therefore the granting of visas for entrepreneurs and for so-called therapeutic stays is unlimited. The second dangerous channel of migration to the Czech Republic is through studies. Arab students bring sponsorship money from Arab countries to higher education institutions, so there is no problem for them to get a student visa.
