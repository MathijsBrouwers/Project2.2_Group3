[Ed. – Suddenly, Newsweek cares that the Hillary case might be politicized? When Comey and the media have been politicizing it all along, by giving Hillary special treatment that no one else on earth would have gotten in the same circumstances?] 
Why did FBI Director James Comey shock Washington on Friday with an announcement that the FBI “has learned of the existence of emails” related to Hillary Clinton’s private email server, and what does it mean? 
The truth is Comey didn’t have a choice. Because the new information followed his sworn testimony about the case, Comey was obligated by Department of Justice rules to keep the relevant committees apprised. 
Under oath Comey had stated that the bureau had completed its review. Once he learned that there were new emails that required examination, Comey had to notify Congress that he had to amend his testimony because it was no longer true. … 
Had Comey not told Congress and it emerged after the election that new materials had come into its possession, the director and his entire agency’s credibility might have been questioned. 
In his letter, Comey did not use the phrase being touted by Republicans that the case had been reopened. Technically it was never closed.
