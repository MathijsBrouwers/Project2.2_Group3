The protests in Georgia are an absurdist theatre that has been going on for 30 years. The recent outbreak of protests was carefully planned and prepared in advance. The fascist "Nationalist" opposition was well prepared. There can be no doubt that everything was a meticulously planned and organised provocation. The "protocol incident", when a member of the Russian parliament appeared in the chair of the Parliament's speaker, was only the trigger of the events. Rustaveli Avenue is not only a beloved landmark of the Georgian capital, but also an almost sacred place for the people of Tbilisi, who used to walk on the Avenue just as believers go to the Temple. The opposition has turned the Rustaveli into a fiery volcano with mud-throwing geysers.

This is the price of democracy Ã  la America.
