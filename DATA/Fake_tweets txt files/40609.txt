The head of the SPD movement Tomio Okamura says that the Czech Republic is under a threat of a terrorist attacks. According to him, if there was no danger, no anti-terrorist barracks would be placed in public places, and no policemen would go with the machine gun among the public places. In addition Czech safety is out of the governmental control, because Czech citizens have become hostages of the EU's multicultural policy.
