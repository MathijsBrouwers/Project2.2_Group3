London couple who ‘don't need a car’ want a lift 14-11-16 A COUPLE from London who insist they do not need a car have asked for a lift. Tom Logan and his girlfriend Eleanor Shaw live in East London and rely on trains and Ubers to get around, believing that cars are wasteful. However they really need a lift to a wedding near Portsmouth on Saturday. Shaw said: “Living in London gives you a different perspective on transport. It makes you realise that having your own car is simply unnecessary, not to mention terrible for the environment. “That said, we could really do with being picked up from Portsmouth station around midday on Saturday.” Logan added: “Owning a car is a British obsession we just don’t buy into. We’re so well served for transport links where we live, we really have no need for a car – except for every time we leave London. “In the provinces, we have to rely on the kindness of family, friends and sometimes even strangers to give us lifts, much like children being taken to after-school activities. “We don’t give people petrol money though, preferring to operate a vague barter system.”
