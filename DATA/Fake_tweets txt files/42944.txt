For years, we have been doing unfriendly and even hostile acts against Russia. I recall that France has expelled Russian diplomats in the context of the Skripal case. Where are we now in the Skripal case? Where are we in the case of the Malaysian plane where Russia was blamed while the Prime Minister of Malaysia denounced a few weeks ago the fact that this investigation was completely biased against the Russia?

Russia has a very predictable diplomatic policy, it respects international law, while French policy is very contradictory.

We should put the things on the table! We need to do international investigations on the MH17 plane because this case is not clear. On the Skripal case, it's not clear. On the case of the bombings in Syria, it is not clear!
