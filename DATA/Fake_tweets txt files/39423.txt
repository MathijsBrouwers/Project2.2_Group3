Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko is fighting against the country's own citizens. Everyone who has relatives with Russian citizenship will be declared "enemy of Ukraine" and punished immediately.

Poroshenko wants to sow discord between relatives and families. He uses this "anti-Russian hysteria" to win the upcoming presidential elections.
