The US wants to create an archive of billions of posts made by social media users to do a big data analysis. This will help to identify users in different countries who are critical of their respective Governments, to target these users with specific ads and to get them out on the streets.

There was a similar leak after Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony to the US Congress when Bloomberg discovered a collection of Russian users in its Facebook Ads Manager who were ready to commit treason. Apparently, the US prepares a provocative response.
