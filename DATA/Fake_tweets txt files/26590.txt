Here is Trump’s full statement: 
I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.Â The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s investigation.Â And they are re-opening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United Staes of America. 
Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody’s hope that it is about to be corrected. 
So that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago, and I guess obviously most of you folksÂ have heard about. And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently 4-Star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. 
With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We’ll bring back our jobs, we’ll strengthen our military… 
Twitter reacted accordingly. Trump, at Manchester, N.H. rally, says FBI decision to reopen Clinton email case suggests "the system might not be so rigged"
