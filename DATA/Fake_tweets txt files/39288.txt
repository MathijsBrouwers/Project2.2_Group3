The European Parliament's resolution on the case of Mehman HuseynovÂ is just a pretext to discredit Azerbaijan. Forces, hostile to Azerbaijan and envious of the country's achievements, are trying to create instability and chaos. One can note the work of the Armenian Lobby and their "brandy diplomacy" in the attempts to defame Azerbaijan. Europe must make a choice between Armenian brandy diplomacy and reliable energy supplies from Azerbaijan.
