Speaking of the death penalty, the European community which bothers Belarus and Russia, should mind its own business. Only absolute idiots can abolish the death penalty. In Russian, a moratorium on death penalty was introduced by Yeltsin in 1996 and it is not clear for how long the population will tolerate this outrage. At the same time, the EU does not make claims against the U.S. or Japan which keep the death penalty.
