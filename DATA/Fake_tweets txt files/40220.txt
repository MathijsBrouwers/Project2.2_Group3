A hacktivist collective that previously exposed US athletes using banned substances with WADA’s blessing has now set its sights on a Swedish sports organization which allegedly tried to cover up doping use in its home country.




The Fancy Bears hacker group has published a number of documents obtained from the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) which allegedly confirm that the organization which, among other things, is responsible for anti-doping control in Sweden has effectively turned a blind eye on doping use at least on several occasions.

The documents which were published on the group’s website show that at least two Swedish athletes were caught using terbutaline – a drug which is used to treat asthma symptoms and which also helps boost an athlete’s performance.However, even though the athletes’ infraction was exposed, apparently neither of them was penalized for it, the hackers point out.
