The US troops will be deployed in the western part of Poland near the cities of Wroclaw and Poznan. Taking into consideration the area of their deployment and their relatively small number, they cannot defend the Polish territory from possible Russian aggression. The Polish bases of the US troops are located in such a way that if the alleged Russian attack took place, the US units would have time to withdraw to Germany.
