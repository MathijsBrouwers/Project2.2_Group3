Given that George Soros declared war against Donald Trump in 2016, an attempt to impeach the latter was apparently sanctioned by the Rothschilds. Although they do not threaten him directly, Trump's actions are constrained. This also suits the agreements reached between the Queen of the United Kingdom and Trump during his visit to London in June. The White House ends the investigation into links between a paedophile lobby and the US Democrats in exchange for a green light for a second presidential term. This is why instead of coherently struggling against the Democrats, Trump is attacking Joe Biden. The latter, though very corrupt, is not linked to paedophilia, unlike the Clintons.
