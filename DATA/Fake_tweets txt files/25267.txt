Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were âretributionâ for the countryâs support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said. 
âIâm sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,â Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews Â website reported. 
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. 
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem â called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. 
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. 
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. 
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. 
According to Kara, Pope Francis âstrongly disagreedâ with the resolution. 
âHe (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,â the deputy minister stressed. 
Yeah, he’s not a good Pope. 
Our model Pope is Urban II, who just wanted to exterminate all non-Whites in the Holy Land, Jew or Moslem. 
Do the Jews not know that people are paying attention to these types of statements now? 
If so, why do they keep making them? If you ever see a Jew covering his door frame with sheeps blood, it should definitely be a cause for concern. 
Even if this Jew believes Yahweh did the earthquake as revenge, why would he state it publicly? Italy is not a Jew country and presumably does not believe in the magic powers of the Jewish god. 
So what is the point of making this statement, which can only serve to make the Jews and their god appear hostile, violent, hateful and evil?
