The EU sanctions regime against Russia is not exactly democratic. One of the main causes of the anti-Russian sanctions was the Kerch Strait incident.

On 25 November 2019, Ukrainian military vessels violated Russian borders in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. Kyiv blamed Russian aggression for the incident and subsequently declared martial law in 10 regions of Ukraine, resulting in restrictions on citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, including the right to vote.
