Hillary Clinton has gone and done it now! After acting like she has nothing to hide in the emails seized by the FBI, she managed to pull some strings and sabotage the NEW investigation before it even began… 
It turns out that she got her good friend Loretta Lynch to assign a man named Peter Kadzik from the Department of Justice to oversee the case against her. Peter Kadzik 
So who is Peter Kadzik? Well, thanks to Wikileaks we know that he is a good, personal friend of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager and future Chief of Staff if she wins. 
In fact, Peter Kadzik was mentioned more than TWENTY TIMES in Podesta’s emails! 
Now just try and tell me that is not as rigged as it gets. 
This is gonna be an all out war between the FBI and the Department of Justice, and if we want Hillary to get her just deserts, we gotta be ready to help Director Comey fight back! 
Now, step one to beating Hillary Clinton is to share this out to everyone you know. We the people need to demand a FAIR investigation. NEXT PAGE==>
