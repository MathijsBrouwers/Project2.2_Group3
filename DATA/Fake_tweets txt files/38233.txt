A better look allows us to discern the natural flow of events from the subversive propaganda of Americans and Anglo-Saxons who claim world domination, a sort of Fourth thousand-year Reich. Since China is not willing to accept American world order and promotes an alternative model for globalisation, it should experience a colour revolution. The US does not have the guts to arrange it in Beijing, so Hong Kong was burnt first, a peripheral China with a large concentration of US secret services. The situation is presented as if the protests are organised by ordinary disgruntled citizens rather than Washingtonâ€™s puppeteers. Without Western meddling, neither the Russian Civil War a hundred years ago nor the protests in Hong Kong would have happened.
