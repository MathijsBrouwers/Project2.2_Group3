Conway: Called Delusional on “The View” November 03, 2016 Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for U.S.... Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to the media at Trump Tower in the... 
The women of "The View" called Donald Trump's campaign manager "delusional", but barely let her speak. 
Kellyanne Conway appeared on ABC's "The View" Wednesday only to be called “delusional” when she attempted to answer a question about Donald Trump's and nuclear weapons. Joy Behar commented that Trump's "rhetoric about nuclear weapons is reckless", but when Conway tried to respond she was interrupted repeatedly and eventually called "delusional". The back and forth banter was more like an aggressive approach to dumb down Conway's answers and of course limit any negative talk about the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who is under intense legal scrutiny just days before election. The women also stated that they did not care if Donald Trump "ever came back on the show". Remains to be seen if they will say the same thing if he wins the nomination.
