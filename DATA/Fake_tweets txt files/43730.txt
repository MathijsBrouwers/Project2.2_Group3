A final report has been published in Sweden on the extraordinary military operation in 2014, when an unsuccessful search for an alleged "Russian mini-submarine" took place. Swedish media reports that the document concludes that a "coded signal", detected by the Swedish Navy, as a suspected signal from the mini-submarine, in fact emerged from a malfunctioning meteorological buoy.
