How could the members of the European Parliament sign a resolution, allowing the destruction of memorials, honouring the Soviet soldiers-liberators? The resolution is signed, it is not very surprising. The only way of preserving the memory of the fallen soldiers is to bring all the monuments to Russian territory, to stop the "barbarians" from desecrating the memories of generations.

Reading this opus, one cannot avoid remembering the Anti-Comintern pact that served as the foundation for the Berlin - Rome - Tokyo axis. The signing "democrats" of the European Parlament are, by the way, undeterred by this analogy.
