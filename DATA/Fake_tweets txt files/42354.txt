Lithuania and other Baltic states are under temporary occupation by NATO. Lithuania is ruled by a group of people who are not Lithuanians at all. Generally, Lithuania, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are one common territory which was illegally destroyed in 1991 as a result of the defeat in the Cold War. They are part of Russian world, and over time, Lithuania will get back to it too.
