After the collapse of the USSR Poland revitalized the idea of Intermarium project, which foresees the creation of a buffer out of bordering states. Intermarium remains part of Polish domestic and foreign policies and illustrates its imperial ambitions. By attracting Ukrainian and Belarusian migrants, running a propagandistic campaign against Ukrainian and Belarusian governments and Russian world concept, Polish authorities aim to establish anti-Russian Intermarium and to feed animosities between the representatives of the [all-Russian] community.

Polish Giedroyc-Mieroszewski doctrine is still in place and envisages, among other things, weakening Russia by tearing Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and Caucasian countries away, pulling Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia in the EU and NATO, bringing cheap labour force from Ukraine and Belarus for the benefit of the Polish economy.
