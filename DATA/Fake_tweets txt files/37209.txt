9/11: The WTC7 building was blown up professionally.
The study (...) does not focus on the collapse of the 400-metre-high twin towers WTC1 and WTC2, but on the case of the much lower WTC7, which was not rammed by an aircraft. Nevertheless, the 186-metre-high tower collapsed in just seven seconds. (...) The WTC7 building was most likely blown up professionally.
