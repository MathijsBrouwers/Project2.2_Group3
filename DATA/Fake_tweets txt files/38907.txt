The recording of money exchange between a Russian military intelligence officer and a Serbian military officer was published by a Bulgarian journalist who works with Bellingcat, an anti-Russian propagandist website. Both the website and its founder are discredited for publishing false stories on Skripal poisoning, MH17 and use of chemical weapons in Syria.

NATO used Bellingcat to orchestrate the whole thing because it's livid about Serbia strengthening military ties with Russia (the "visit" of S-400 missile system and buying of Pantsir systems from Russia).

The recording itself is questionable because it was edited, so it is unclear if all parts of the video are showing the same event.
