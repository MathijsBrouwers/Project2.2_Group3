Minsk metro station names are spelled using the Latin alphabet based on an artificial variation of the Polish alphabet. This transliterationÂ has no official recognition. Foreigners and locals alike do not understand it. Minsk metro stations should use the Russian names instead of the Belarusian ones, which are spelled using the Belarusian Latin alphabet.
