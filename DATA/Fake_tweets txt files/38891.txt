Both European- and US-manufactured vaccines available in Georgia are unreliable. There is no way to verify that they are really manufactured in Europe or in the United States, and not at the Lugar lab. As for the United States, even if the vaccine manufacturer is verified to be based there, the quality of vaccination controls varies between different US states. Therefore, if one has to get vaccinated, it is better to choose a Russian-manufactured vaccine over a US-manufactured one or the one created at the Lugar lab.
