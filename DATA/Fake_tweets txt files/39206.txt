The Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido studied in a Catholic university. Vatican, which oversees all the Catholic universities in the world, is an old partner of Washington in the "color revolutions" (e.g. in Ukraine) and played a big role in organising the coup in Venezuela.Â  

Guaido also received a master's degree in management at the George Washington University, where, for example, Mikheil Saakashvili studied. Apart from studying, Guaido joined the totalitarian sect of Freemasons. Saakashvili also became a Freemason in the US. 

Vatican is strongly linked to the Freemasonry. Over the past year, it has been actively involved in organising insurrections against legitimate governments in Hong Kong, Nicaragua, Belarus, and Brazil. It is also involved in the organisation of a "colour revolution" in Poland, together with the US.


In fact, the Holy Fathers have turned into an ideological tool of the anti-Christian minded globalists.
