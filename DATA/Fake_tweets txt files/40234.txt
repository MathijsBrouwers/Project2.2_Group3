U.S. sanctions against companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska (who is also personally a target of the U.S. sanctions) would seriously damage American businesses. Sanctioning Deripaska’s company Rusal, the world’s second-largest aluminum producer, would hurt companies like the Ford Motor Company. The company would not have enough aluminum to supply the market demand for the popular Ford F150 pickup truck.
