It’s very bad that European countries do not understand where the USA’s thoughtless policy leads. Political elites in Europe either do not think about it or are influenced and patronised by American political elites to such extent that must just stupidly obey them.

It is an American tradition to fight by someone else’s hands and on someone else’s territory, if only the USA would not suffer, therefore Europeans act as cannon fodder here.
