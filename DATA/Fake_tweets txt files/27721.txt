Everyone worried winter hats make them look like dicks 15-11-16 MILLIONS of Britons are feeling unconfident in their warm winter headgear. As temperatures drop, streets are full of people checking themselves out in reflective surfaces while nervously fiddling with headwear that they do not feel quite right about. Beret-wearer Nikki Hollis said: “I thought it was sophisticated, but I’ve just seen myself in the window of the bookies and I look like an A-level philosophy student or minor Mad Men character.” Tom Booker, the owner of a new beanie, said: “I started with a bobble hat, but my girlfriend said I looked ‘adorable’ and pinched my cheek. “I bought this one last week, but now I’m thinking it’s too big. Do I look like Brian Harvey from East 17? “We desperately need more good hat role models.” The Institute for Studies confirmed that everyone would be too busy worrying about their own hat to judge others, although anything with animal ears would be rightly shunned.
