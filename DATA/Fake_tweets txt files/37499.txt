There should be a strong information and education stream of truth telling that Belarusians and Great Russians are integral branches of one, Russian people, which was artificially divided. The reunification of divided Russian people of Great, Little, and White Rus' and the victory over anti-Christian Western globalist project is sacred.

Only a few Nazis and their liberal friends in Vatican and Moscow stand against the sacred Union of Great and White Rus'. The Vatican actively assists Belarusian Nazis. The Belarusian Catholic Church considers heroes the terrorists Kasciushka and Kalinowski. It wants to repeat Ukrainian Maidan in Minsk. Tadevush Kondrasevich, the Belarusian Roman Catholic Archbishop, is also an expert in the creation of "fifth column" in the Russian Orthodox Church. In the meantime Orthodox majority prays for Vladimir Putin and Alyaksandr Lukashenka and for the resolution of Belarus-Russia integration issues by 20 December.
