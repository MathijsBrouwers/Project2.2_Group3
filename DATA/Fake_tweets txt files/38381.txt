On April 25 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a new language law, that is a violation of Ukraine’s Constitution, Russian speakers will be discriminated against and their rights will be violated. The new law violates scores of international agreements and treaties that Ukraine was party to. The law for obligatory use of Ukrainian language in the state sector is the cherry on the “Russophobic” cake that Ukraine has been baking for 5 years.
