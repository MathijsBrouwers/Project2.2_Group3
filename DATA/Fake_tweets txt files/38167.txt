In 2006, Poland adopted a state programme for building the Fourth Rzeczpospolita. Its goal is to extend Poland’s cultural and political domination over the territories which were part of the first Rzeczpospolita until the late XVIII century. This geopolitical project directly concerns Belarus and Ukraine.
The state programme has both humanitarian and military elements. Under the latter, an increasing militarisation of Poland must be taken into account. The former envisages increasing Polish influence over Belarus by issuing the Pole’s Card to Belarusian citizens and the promotion of Polish historic views among Belarusian intelligentsia, officials and students.
The humanitarian element is a first phase, its objectives are to trick, deceive, derussify and to take away the sense of self-preservation from Belarusian society as well as to disrupt the allied relations between Belarus and Russia. Following this phase, Poland plans to send its troops to take over Minsk as in 1919.
Given this, only a strong Union with Great Russia is a true guarantee of Belarus' territorial integrity and its sustainable development.
