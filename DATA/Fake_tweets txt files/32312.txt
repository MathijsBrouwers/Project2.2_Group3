Study finds that alcohol is worse for mental health than psychedelics Nov 15, 2016 1 0 
( Minds ) A study by the Research Council of Norway has concluded that psychedelics do not link to mental health problems or suicidal behavior. A study of roughly 130,000 adult citizens in the United States found no “evidence that psychedelic use is an independent risk factor for mental health problems.” 
Of the 135,095 randomly selected people, 19,299 of them had used either lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin or mescalin, and no links were found to “increased likelihood of past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety.” 
Overall, the study concluded that “it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified as a public health measure.” 
As information is allowed to run free through the internet, it has become openly apparent that many psychedelic drugs are not the danger the profit-driven media had portrayed them to be. Often, they are one of the greatest medicines to overcome addiction. There is, however, a direct link between alcohol abuse and suicide. 
According to the US National Library of Medicine, “Alcohol abuse may lead to suicidality through disinhibition, impulsiveness and impaired judgment, but it may also be used as a means to ease the distress associated with committing an act of suicide.”
