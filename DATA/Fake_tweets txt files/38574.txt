Belarusian nationalists promote Polish and Lithuanian agendas and manipulate society by saying that national idea is absent in Belarus. The Belarusian society bought this manipulation and even president Alyaksandr Lukashenka publicly stated that the national idea has to be formulated for the country. In fact, this a false message because the actual national idea has always been present and its essence is that Belarusians are Russians. Minor differences that Belarusians have are the result of Polish and Baltic influences.
