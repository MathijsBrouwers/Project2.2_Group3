The European Union wants to ban the spread of alternative points of view about what is happening in Syria. In the EU, they continue to insist that it was a chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma, in April 2018. The EU has presented no hard evidence about the attack and Western countries have fabricated evidence.

Syria has no stockpiles of chemical weapons.
