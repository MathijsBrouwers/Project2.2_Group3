It’s official, she’s NUTS! Donna Brazile thinks Democrats can turn THIS state blue (hint: no way in Hell) Posted at 11:01 am on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. 
As we near the election (only 11 days now, thank God) Donna Brazile must be feeling a tad cocky because she was blathering on about turning a specific and very red state, blue. 
We laughed a LOT before actually writing this piece, especially when we read this tweet: One of the things I've wanted to do as party chair is invest in states across the country. We're ready to turn Utah blue. #ForwardTogether

HA. Utah. One of the reddest most conservative states in the UNION. The state hasn’t supported a Democrat in over 50 years (the last time the state went for the Democrat was 1964) and yet Donna thinks the Democrats can turn it blue. 
Witch please. @donnabrazile I'll take how DonnaBrazile cheats for her candidate besides stealing questions for them for $500. Alex

Clearly she’ll do ANYTHING to move that ol’ gray mare forward. Yup. @donnabrazile Nah, it's property of the #mormonmafia now. You'll have to speak to @Evan_McMullin now if you want to operate in his state.
