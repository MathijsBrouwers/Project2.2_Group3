A tipsy Texas collegian was taking a topless Snapchat photo for her boyfriend last night moments before she crashed her car into a cruiser, according to cops. 
Miranda Kay Rader, 19, drove her SUV into the rear of a squad car whose driver had exited the vehicle to investigate a disturbance call. Rader, seen at right, was not injured in the 8:30 PM crash in Bryan, a city bordering College Station, home to Texas A&M (where Rader is a freshman). 
When a patrolman approached Rader’s Acura, he noticed that the student had on an “unclasped brassiere” and was “attempting to put a black blouse on.” When the officer asked why she “was not dressed while driving,” Rader replied that she had been “taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at the red light.” 
Rader said she was en route to her Texas A&M dormitory at the time of the crash, according to a probable cause affidavit .
