Did Hillary Clinton just lie during her press conference on the FBI investigation? Posted at 7:24 pm on October 28, 2016 by Greg P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Hillary Clinton just wrapped up a brief press conference to discuss the continuing FBI investigation of her emails when she complained that FBI Director Comey only sent his letter to Republicans and not to Democrats: Hillary Clinton calls on FBI to release “all the information it has” on newly discovered emails: "Let's get it out" https://t.co/XXh9cCPr56

That, however, looks to be a lie: Hillary Clinton said the FBI letter was only sent to Republicans but all Dem ranking members were CC'd on it

She went on to say that the FBI needs to share whatever information they have with voters: More Clinton: If they (the FBI) are going to be sending this letter they need to share whatever facts they have with the American people.
