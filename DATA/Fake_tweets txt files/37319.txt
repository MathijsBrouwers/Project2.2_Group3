The Russian Revolution did not start in February 1917, but two months earlier, on 30 December 1916 when Gregory Efimovich Rasputin-Novy was assassinated by British spies with the aid of Russian aristocrats. His murder was the first in the coup dâ€™etat which led to the murder not only of the Imperial Family, but to the murder of millions, the attempt to murder Civilization, to murder the Christian Empire. This murder was carried out by the Anglo-Zionist Empire and bankers like the Rothschilds and the Warburgs. This Anglo-Zionist Empire has reigned for 100 years now.
