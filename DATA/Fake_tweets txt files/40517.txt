You [Ukraine] were the first to start a war against us [Russia]. You began to beg for oil. The oil was constantly being stolen [from Russia]. [...] That is, it was you, who started the hostile actions. We did not do anything. You began forbidding …, expelling our people. That was, all the time. [...] All the actions of the Ukrainian leadership were taken against Russia.

// You, in Ukraine, must understand that we will not fight with America. But they [the Americans] will force you to attack us [Russia] and then you will get in deep trouble. They need a small war. [...] The war will start unexpectedly: at four o’clock in the morning [the time of the Germany’s intrusion into the USSR in 1941]. Your [Ukraine's] cities will be bombed by the aircrafts of an other country and the missiles will blow up all your bases. All your military personnel will be destroyed. All of them.
