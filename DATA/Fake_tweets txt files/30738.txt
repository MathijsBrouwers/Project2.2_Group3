VIDEO : MICHIGAN REVS UP FOR TRUMP! VIDEO : MICHIGAN REVS UP FOR TRUMP! Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 7, 2016 
I am originally from Michigan, so my heart leaped with JOY when I watched Trump’s rally. 
I have spent many a summer nights at Freedom Hill (back when it was called Pine Knob) catching a concert – and I can honestly say that I have never in my life seen that amphitheater look so ENERGIZED and rock SO HARD as I did when I watched Sunday night’s Trump rally. 
It was AMAZING beyond words and made me SO PROUD to be from Michigan. 
What we’re witnessing is more than a movement, folks. 
It’s a REVOLUTION.
