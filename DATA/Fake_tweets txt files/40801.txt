The USAID funds aim to decentralize Moldova. This will mean that the power will pass from the national authorities to the local ones. In this context the local authorities will be absolutely dependent on foreign donors. This actually is proved by the activity of the declared program of the United States Agency for International Development.

An infrastructure with manual control at the local levelÂ is created in front of us, strongly linked to the American institutes and development funds.
