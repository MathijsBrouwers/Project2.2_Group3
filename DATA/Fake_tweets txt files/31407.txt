VIDEO : New Powerful Trump ad Targets Hindu and Indian Americans VIDEO : New Powerful Trump ad Targets Hindu and Indian Americans Videos By Amy Moreno October 27, 2016 
The America First movement is for ALL AMERICANS . 
Contrary to what the North Korea-style government-run propaganda media, whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections says, ALL AMERICANS are welcome aboard the Trump Train. 
We’re an INCLUSIVE movement, and our online, and “real life” diversity proves that. 
In a powerful new ad, Trump reaches out to the Indian and Hindu community who truly love Donald Trump. 
Watch the video: This is a movement – we are the political OUTSIDERS fighting against the FAILED GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT! Join the resistance and help us fight to put America First!
