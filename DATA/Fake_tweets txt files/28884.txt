Chris Hansen has made a career of entrapping alleged child predators online and then busting them on camera when they arrive at a home where they think a young child is waiting. 
But in the latest episode of Hanson’s show “ Crime Watch Daily ,” the host claims he got an unexpected shock when he learned the identity of the latest alleged predator. 
“I honestly did not realize it until I walked out. And then I suddenly recognized him because we used to commute into the city every day together from Connecticut,” Hansen told The Daily Mail . 
The man is accused of traveling to a home where he believed he would be meeting a 13-year-old boy. When the alleged predator saw Hansen, he blurted out, “Oh s**t. No, Chris!” Image Credit: “Crime Watch Daily”/Daily Mail 
“What are you doing here?” Hansen asked. 
The man then made a run for it. He was later allegedly found with gay porn and condoms in his car. When he was questioned by police, he claimed he thought the boy was 18, not 13, citing his bad eye sight. He argued he would never meet a 13-year-old boy, calling it “disgusting.” Image Credit: “Crime Watch Daily”/Daily Mail 
“I could not believe it,” Hansen told The Daily Mail , grappling with the fact that she shared a train and even carried on conversations with the alleged predator. 
The man later confirmed Hansen’s story and suggested they were “friends.” 
The new episode of “ Crime Watch Daily ” will air on Friday.
