Amnesty International's report claims Google and Facebook's business models are a threat to human rights. The organisation has always been an ideological tool of the US security services and a US soft power, just as Greenpeace, WWF, and other human rights and ecological NGOs. Hence, Amnesty International's report is a position of the US's establishment and part of the US's political war against Facebook. The US has, for a long time, effectively controlled central media, which promote LGBT, global warming, Greta Thunberg, inflow of migrants to Europe, so called chemical attacks in Syria, Russian hackers, Hillary Clinton, protests in Hong-Kong, harassment of Harvey Weinstein, and anything else which is necessary for the political agenda. Yet the Western world, and the US as its flagship, are concerned with uncontrolled freedom of speech on social media, including for their ideological opponents - be it Russians, Turks, North Koreans, or Venezuelans.

Against the background of increasing erosion of 'soft power' and collapse of liberal ideology the West starts to introduce rather strict censorship to protect its ideological machine. Given that you cannot name censorship using its own words, various euphemisms are used instead, fake news in the first place. The Western media are themselves the main producers of fakes, lies are a part of their metabolism. Fake news is just a label to tag everything that does not suit a certain ideological model. Under the pretext of fighting fake news and Russian hackers, the West introduces censorship and open manual controls over the media sphere. Earlier, an instrument of pressure on Facebook and other corporations was the alleged meddling of Russians in the US elections and fake news. Now, Amnesty International's report puts forward "information manipulation" and "abuse of privacy" as new buzz words and a pretext for attacking Facebook and Google.
