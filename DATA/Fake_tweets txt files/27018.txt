This woman’s “floating head” halloween make-up is genius 
@Ailishoctigan over on Twitter writes, “My halloween floating head realness:” 
@Ailishoctigan says, “I started with a red oval about halfway up my neck then filled above that to my jawline with black…” 
And amazingly she did it all with this simple paint: 
Brilliant.
