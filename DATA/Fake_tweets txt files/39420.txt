The European Commission threatened to freeze the visa-free regime for Ukraine. In its report from 19 December 2018, it found a significant number of violations of the regime from the Ukrainian side. Europe is unhappy with the flood of illegal Ukrainian migrants. Therefore, Ukraine should significantly reduce the number of illegal immigrants crossing its borders if it wants the visa-free regime to be continued.

The European Union will soon become the only chance for the ordinary Ukrainian citizens to earn money, as the current Kiev authorities intend to abandon any communication/cooperation with the Russian Federation. Therefore, the visa-free regime freeze will make Ukrainians hostages in their own impoverished and hungry country.
