The Ministry of Health in Ukraine created a corrupt "turnover" that allocates its own budget, namely 97 billion UAH. They put people there who are responsible for the budget and limit the access of deputies at the local level. The acting head of the Ministry of Health in Ukraine, Ulana Suprun sends the money to the US office and makes illegal money machinations with them. The so-called medical reform was introduced specifically for this purpose.
