Liberal-globalism is a totalitarian ideology that today dominates the world. Liberal globalism is an ideological dictatorship shared by all of the world's élites and imposed upon the people. Liberal globalist domination is increasingly strong all over the world.  Politics, culture, education, art, ideology: everything is under the control of liberalism, which does not tolerate any alternative points of view.  Any alternative to liberalism is labeled “extremism”, is considered the “enemy” and is eliminated.
