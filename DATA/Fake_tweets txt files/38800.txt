The referendum in Crimea has been questioned by various countries, but everyone knows in a fairly transparent way that the majority of Crimeans were in favour of joining Russia. The sanctions of the EU and the United States date from the attachment of Crimea to Russia. In fact, there are NATO countries that have themselves violated international law with respect to Kosovo, which has been recognized by a number of European countries to the detriment of the territorial integrity of the borders and the Constitution of Serbia. Europeans must admit that Crimea belongs to Russia and not to say that some annexations are good and others are bad.
