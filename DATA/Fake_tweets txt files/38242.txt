A report written by OPCW engineers who went on the ground in Syria to Douma says that all the images, all the videos of this famous day of April 7, 2018 day of the alleged chemical attack in Douma of the damage caused do not correspond with the hypothesis of gas cylinders released from the air. Another place, another incoherence. A cylinder that just could not get where it was found with its valve still intact. The only rational explanation for them and that the two gas bottles were already on the spot. But these explanations clearly contradict the official report.

This new report changes everything. In summary, observations at the scene of the two locations, together with subsequent analysis, suggest that there is a higher probability that both cylinders were manually placed at those two locations rather than being delivered from an aircraft. The OPCW does not comment. But what we learned, thanks to those leaks,puts their final findings in question.
