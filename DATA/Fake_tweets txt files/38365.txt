Europe is defacing itself and its existence. It is not Europe of Peter and Paul, it is not Europe of big men and not Europe of big Roman bishops. Contemporary Europe in its anti-Christian spirit is more godless than communism. Communism inherited at least a little bit of Christian morality. Europe has neither that spirit, nor that morality and today it completely destroys Christianity and becomes an Islamic zone.
