This is so, so funny. 
The top SJW kike himself, Mark Zuckerberg, has been caught using logical means to sell advertisements. 
But logic, we goyim have been told, is pure hatred. 
No idea why they thought they could get away with this.

A scandal is brewing over the discovery that advertisers on Facebook can ânarrowâ their audience by race and ethnicity, allowing them to remove their ads from the feeds of selected demographics, including African American, Asian and Hispanic. 
Micro-targeting, which assigns an ethnicity to users based on their page activity, is designed by Facebook to be used to target niche audiences, but it also allows for exclusion. Facebook claims advertisers are prohibited from abusing the tool, such as using it to discriminate. 
An ad purchased by ProPublica gave them the option to remove certain ethnic groups from viewing a housing ad. 
âThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find,â civil rights lawyer John Relman told the publication. 
Facebook responded to ProPublicaâs report saying they believed, âmulticultural advertising should be a tool for empowerment,â adding that they expect advertisers to use the service in compliance with the law. 
âWhen World Cup 2014 became a big focus throughout the US Hispanic community, a business developed a campaign to reach people who had shown interest in that community in order to create a positive association between its brand and the worldâs most popular sport. This meant more relevant ads to those audiences about the World Cup,” the social media giant said, pointing out an example of micro-targeting being used successfully. 
Facebook also said that ads in different languages were another example of the feature being useful for its clients. 
It was a clever troll. 
I am in awe. 
I of course don’t think this should be illegal – it is absolutely nonsensical to make it illegal to prefer certain races over another in any context. Even if you believe “race doesn’t exist,” the fact remains that the different races statistically act very differently from each other, so very much can be determined about a person by knowing their race. 
But it is so funny to see the SJW Jew Zuckerberg caught in his own Jew web of nonsensical gibberish.
