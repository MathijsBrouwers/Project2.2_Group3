Washington and London press President Aleksandr Lukashenko to conduct a political reform, consisting in the opposition, controlled by the West, receiving at least 45% votes in the parliament. Lukashenko would have 30% of seats in the parliament and the remaining ones will be given to marginal parties, including 2% for the quickly created pro-Russian ones. Only then would the US promise loans to Belarus.
