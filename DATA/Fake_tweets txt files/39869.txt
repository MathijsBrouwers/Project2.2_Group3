A few years ago colossal deposits of lithium were discovered in Bolivia. Big corporations are in urgent need of access to lithium, a key metal for the production of electric car batteries. Hence it totally can be that the coup was lobbied by the heads of big American manufacturers of electric cars. We also have good reason to believe that the key role in the coup belonged to Bolivian military elite and the heads of intelligence services, who were driven by personal ambitions and racist sentiments towards local Indian population. A military coup in Bolivia was fascist. Interim president Janine Áñez announced hunt of Aymara and Quechua peoples, who make more than a half of Bolivian population. The risk is Bolivian fascist fundamentalists will not only take over deposits of natural resources, but will start ethnocide with the complicity of the US and its satellites.
