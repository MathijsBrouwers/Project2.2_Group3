The statement about the 'nuclear death risk' for Lithuania posed by the Belarusian nuclear power plant, made by Lithuanian politician Vytautas Landsbergis, is designed to create a negative image of the Russian nuclear energy sector. It also intends to hurt Belarusian-Russian energy cooperation. Lithuania expects to tear Belarus away from Russia and integrate it into the Western electricity network. Such anti-Russian statements are very characteristic of Lithuanian politics as its state policies make Lithuania one of the most Russophobic countries.
