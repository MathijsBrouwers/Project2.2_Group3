The dramatic wave of crime in Sweden is no longer limited to the main cities and spreads to rural communities as well. Police warn that foreign criminals see Sweden as the most attractive country. If you steal something, the probability of being caught is almost zero. Municipalities in Sweden suffer from the lack of free houses and apartments. This is because they have to give priority to the newly arrived asylum seekers and immigrants. The Swedish government wants to accommodate more than 100,000 immigrants by 2018.
