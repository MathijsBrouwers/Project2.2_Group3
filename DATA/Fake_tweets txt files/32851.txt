Trump smiles, waves, starts rounding them up 09-11-16 A SMILING president-elect Donald Trump has instructed aides to ‘get them’. The 45th president of the United States grinned and waved at cheering supporters as he whispered the simple instruction into a henchman’s ear. An onlooker said: “It wasn’t clear who ‘they’ are but I think we can assume it’s people with whom Donald is not on the best of terms, or whose features are not ideally suited to modern America. “And it’s too early to say why they were being ‘got’. Perhaps they were being taken to a nice celebration party with free massive cookies for all, or maybe something a tad more sinister. “I think he also mentioned ‘get the witch first’ but it was hard to hear over all the cheering. “These really are interesting times.”
