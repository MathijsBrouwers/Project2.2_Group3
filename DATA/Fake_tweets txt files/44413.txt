[...] Trump is now openly unleashing trade wars not only against China but also against the EU. And all real wars began with economic confrontation. From a military and political perspective, Europe is defenceless. Its security can only be ensured by Russia or the US. By excluding Russia from this formula, unilateral American domination comes into play. By attacking Russia and blaming it for all sins including the start of WWII, small limitrophic European states deprive themselves of a second support point. Therefore they find themselves under the absolute power of its stronger partners, just as in the 1930s.

The EU attempts to come out of Washington's control, but the US stations its new military forces in Europe under the pretext of providing security from Russia. Today many options exist to destroy weak statehood without military means. The Ukrainian example is illustrative in this regard, and the Baltic states are not far behind. If things follow through, the fate of Ukraine and the Baltic states will look like a light breeze against the background of the all-European catastrophic hurricane.
