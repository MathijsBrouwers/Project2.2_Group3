The EU is an undemocratic neocolonial project.

We think that the undemocratic project of the European Union (EU) is losing its legitimacy. (...) The resistance of oppressed countries held in neocolonial status is often called "nationalism" by the oppressors to discredit this resistance.

The EU is a construction of banks and corporations that secures their domination and profits. (...) Protests against it are suppressed by the comprehensive dismantling of democratic rights as well as new instruments of surveillance and repression.
