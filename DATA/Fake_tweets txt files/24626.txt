November 4, 2016 Landmark Paris Climate Agreement Takes Formal Effect 
The most significant international agreement to combat climate change took effect Thursday evening—midnight in Europe—just days before international climate negotiators were set to meet in Morocco to chart a path forward on the issue. 
The Paris Agreement’s entry into force comes a month after countries representing 55% of the world’s emissions committed to joining the deal—the level required to put the agreement into action—and less than a year after negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed to the specifics of the text at the 2015 U.N. climate summit. Next week’s meeting in Marrakech will provide the first opportunity since that summit in Paris for all parties to the agreement to iron out implementation details.
