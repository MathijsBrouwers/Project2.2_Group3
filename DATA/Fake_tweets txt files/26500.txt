Man seems to think he helped out with World War Two 14-11-16 A 42-YEAR-OLD man thinks he had something to do with Britain’s historical military victories. Office manager Martin Bishop frequently expresses pride at how ‘we’ defeated enemies like the Nazis, despite having no military training and not being born at the time. Bishop said: “We showed tyrants like Hitler and Napoleon who’s boss, although my ability to fight them personally has been limited by being born in 1974. “It’s in our national character to never give up, like during the Battle of Britain or when I did that 5km charity run. “I may not have been at our wars in person, but I feel I’m continuing our proud military tradition by watching documentaries about them while having my tea. “If I’d been around at the time I’d definitely have been getting stuck in on D-Day or at the Battle of Agincourt, because I’m a dab hand at archery on the Wii.” However colleague Nikki Hollis said: “When the office went paintballing, Martin mostly hid in a wooden fort. “Also I can’t see him surviving World War One mentally unscathed because he was totally traumatised by the last episode of Blackadder .”
