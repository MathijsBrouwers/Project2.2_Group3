The landing of US astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Мoon in 1969 is the largest deception in the history of mankind. Americans have never been on Earth’s satellite, since there is no evidence other than photographs taken in a studio on Earth. There are no stars in the photo and the US flag is waving, although there is no atmosphere on the Moon. Also there are no traces of the landing of the ship on the satellite. Even Buzz Aldrin himself recently admitted that he had never been on the Moon.

The money allocated for the fake “moon program” was in fact spent on financing the war in Vietnam and the development of the American military industrial complex.


Now Washington and NASA intend to fly to the Moon and even Mars in the same fake way.
