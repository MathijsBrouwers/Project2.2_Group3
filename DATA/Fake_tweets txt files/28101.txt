Tonight, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow i nterviewed widely respected Libertarian VP candidate Bill Weld, who took time out from bashing Republican nominee Donald Trump to drop a truth bomb on live television. Weld served as the Republican Governor of the very blue state of Massachusetts, and has a reputation as a serious public servant of stellar reputation. He said: 
“I’m here vouching for Mrs. Clinton, and I think it’s high time somebody did, and I’m doing it based on my personal experience with her. I think that she deserves to have people vouch for her other than members of the Democratic National Committee.” 
As Rachel Maddow says, it’s not quite an endorsement, but coming from Weld, it’s meaningful personal affirmation of the Democratic nominee’s character and fitness for office from a politician outside her party. We’re sure that the Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson will put out yet another statement denying what you can plainly see in the video below.
