The Ambassador of EU to Georgia, Carl Hartzell has categorically ruled out Georgia’s accession to the European Union.

“You know that a new ambassador has been appointed… and he said directly that ‘we do not expect you in the European Union and you will not be accepted to the European Union’… He did not even give us any hope for the future.”
