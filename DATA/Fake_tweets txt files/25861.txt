Anne-Marie Slaughter, who served at the department from January 2009 until February 2011, stated “off the record” to New York Times columnist Thomas L.

“Honestly, OTR, EVERYONE I knew at State used our private email (I used Princeton) when we were out of the office…” Slaughter wrote. 
Explaining her disdain for the department’s “incredibly clunky and difficult” blackberries, Slaughter admitted that sensitive information was often sent from the State Department to employee’s personal emails. 
“We sent sensitive but unclassified documents to our private emails so we could work on them at home and then sent them back to our work emails,” she said. 
The comments were uncovered Wednesday in WikiLeaks’ 19th release of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta’s emails. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles
