By abandoning Syrian Kurdistan, the U.S. demonstrated that they can betray their allies at any moment just because they are lazy to deal with their problems. The more Poland, the Baltic countries, and other Eastern European fans of American strength will tug uncle Sam's sleeve, shout about "Russian threat" and demand ever more American tanks, grenade launchers, and special forces, the more probable that Americans will betray and leave them to Russia to deal with.

In fact, Russia is neither interested in Baltic countries nor needs them. They are a godforsaken province, a dual periphery of the West and East. However, the Baltic countries constantly reproduce and attempt to sell the conflict, build their international image at the expense of Russia's demonization, demand NATO allies an even larger militarization of Russian border, and take West-Russia cooperation as a threat to their interests. Such inadequate allies may drag the U.S. into the entirely unnecessary conflict and force Americans to defend them a thousand miles away from the U.S. shores. Americans do not need this, hence they will easily hand Baltic states over to Russia.
