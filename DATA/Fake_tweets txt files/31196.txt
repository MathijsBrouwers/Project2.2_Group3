Arnoldski - American intelligence officers stationed at the General Prosecutor and SBU buildings in Kiev have urgently left Ukraine. This was reported by former Verkhovna Rada deputy Igor Markov live on the Russian debate-show “The Meeting Place.” According to Markov, this is evidence that the US is “slyly withdrawing” from Ukraine. “A week ago, all the FBI representatives based at the General Prosecutor and the CIA officers stationed in the SBU were urgently redeployed to Romania and Czech Republic. For security forces, this is a clear signal that the US is slyly withdrawing from Ukraine. Only analysts remain, all operative agents have left,” Markov stated. Follow us on Facebook!
