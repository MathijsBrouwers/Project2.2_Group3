The reason why the HBO series "Chernobyl" is released now (as it's not linked to a proper anniversary) is because Rosatom, created in 2007, became a dangerous competitor to the US, France and Japan in the area of nuclear energy. 

Rosatom became a powerful player, especially after the sanctions introduces in 2014. And suddenly, the series tries to show how wild, stupid and careless Russians are, causing an unprecedented ecological catastrophe in Europe with sloppy built reactors.
