Russia is not a contracting party but, like Germany and France, a guarantor power for the self-proclaimed popular republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Together with Ukraine, they are the ones who have to implement the Minsk agreements, not Russia. If Russia is accused of occupying the Donbas conflict zone in Eastern Ukraine, then this is complete nonsense and lies.
