The US Navy has started to transport migrants to Europe. This comes after the Italian government decided not to allow civil society organisation's ships to dock at Italian ports. NGOs hope that the Italian government will allow the US Navy's ship to dock. Subsequently, the US Navy would continue transporting migrants to European shores.
