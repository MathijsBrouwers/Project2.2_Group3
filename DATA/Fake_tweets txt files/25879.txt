Wholesale premiums rose again slightly on 90% Junk Silver Coins this week, with supply remaining scarce and delayed.

The Sunshine Mint has finally caught up on production of SD Bullion’s most popular silver round, the Sunshine 1 oz Walking Liberty rounds which is now back in stock after experiencing 3-4 week delays in early October. 
No major changes to report for the rest of the wholesale silver market over the past week.
