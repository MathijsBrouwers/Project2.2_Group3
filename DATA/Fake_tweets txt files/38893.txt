The Belarusian authorities are destroying the remainders of the Russian toponyms. The destruction of the Russian language in the public space is a determined state policy. In the Minsk, where most people are Russian speaking, almost no signs in Russian are left; names of state institutions are exchanged from Russian to Belarusian ones. This is happening within another wave of “Belarusianisation” or “de-russification”, which was sanctioned by the Belarusian president Aleksander Lukashenko.
