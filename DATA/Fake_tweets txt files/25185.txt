A bit of good news to kick off your weekend… 
In an interview on the ‘Sway in the Morning’ radio show on Friday, President Obama stated unequivocally that his wife will “never run” for political office. 
“She will never run for office,” said Obama of the 52-year-old First Lady. “She is as talented and brilliant a person as there is, and I could not be prouder of her, but Michelle does not have the patience or the inclination to actually be a candidate herself. That’s one thing y’all can take to the bank.” 
Michelle Obama has become Hillary Clinton’s most effective surrogate on the campaign trail this election season, delivering powerful speeches on behalf of the Democratic nominee whom she hopes will become her husband’s successor. 
The First Lady’s success on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton has only led her supporters to push for her to launch her own political career, though she has long denied that she has any desire to run for political office. 
Indeed, it seems Michelle Obama is much more content living the high life, jet-setting around the world on expensive vacations, using only the most luxurious of accommodations, and paying for none of it herself. That’s for the lowly taxpayers like you and me to do… 
Why hold a job or work to curry favor with the American people when your lavish lifestyle has been handed to you on a silver platter? Considering this, it’s really no surprise Michelle Obama does not wish to run for office after her husband’s term is over, and for that, we are grateful. 
SHARE this report if you are glad to hear that Michelle Obama will not seek political office after she vacates the White House in the coming months… Haven’t we had enough of her?!
