If someone told me to gain 22 pounds in two months, I’d point to the picture of Zac Efron looking all shredded on my workstation and explain, tearfully, how disappointed he’d be in me, and that I just couldn’t do it.

And that’s even if someone told me I had to do it to save my father’s life.

Thankfully, 8-year-old Cao Yinpeng didn’t hesitate for a second when he discovered he’d need to gain 22lbs to donate bone marrow to his dying father.


Yinpeng’s father was struck with leukemia and doctors only gave him six months to live. Cao wanted to donate immediately, but there were two health laws in China that prohibited him from undergoing the procedure that his father desperately needed.

Bone marrow donors in China must be between the ages of 18 and 45 and weigh at least 99lbs.


Doctors will occasionally make exceptions for younger family members, but Cao was still too underweight for the medical professionals to safely extract his bone marrow to save his father’s life.

With no other suitable candidates available for his father, Yinpeng vowed to give his father a chance at life, as his father had done for him.


Now that’s how you raise a child.
