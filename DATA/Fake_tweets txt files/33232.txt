U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez stumped for Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, addressing a crowd of her loyal supporters in Winston-Salem. 
But according to a video obtained by Need to Know (NTK) Network, Perez's speech was interrupted as an Amber Alert sent to multiple phones created a chorus of noise. 
As Fox 46 Charlotte reports, the Amber Alert was about an endangered 2-month-old infant. 
When Perez noticed the noise coming from the crowd, he said: 
“I don't know who that is...” 
As a Hillary supporter told him it was the emergency response system letting Americans know when a missing person or child is missing, Perez chuckled and said: 
“ Amber Alert. Oh yeah? Well, Amber is going to vote for Hillary! I talked to her the other day." 
Fortunately, deputies located the baby, who was with his parents, and the alert was canceled. 
Perez had reportedly joined local officials earlier that day at Winston-Salem State University, speaking out against the National Rifle Association and calling for stricter gun-safety laws. 
His name was also on the VP shortlist prior to Clinton selecting Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and has been tossed around the ring as Hillary Clinton's potential pick for Attorney General, should she win the election.
