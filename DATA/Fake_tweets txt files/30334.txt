Even though this assessment of the Trump win and the implications for American politics going forward is long, it’s also meaty and very much worth your attention. Mark Blyth was virtually the only person to call a Trump victory virtually from the get-go (a colleague who spends a lot of time outside the Acela corridor is another member of that club) but also correctly gamed out how the stock market would react. 
Everything Blyth says is incisive, colorful, and on the mark. By contrast, it’s frustrating listening to Schiller because she is invested in way too much of the Dem orthodoxy, such as the Hillary scandals were manufactured by Republicans, that Sanders would have lost if he were the Democratic candidate, that Clinton was a victim of being a woman with a long political career (hello?). Similarly, towards the end, Blyth says, “There is no left left,” and explains why, and then Schiller begs to differ by trying to depict the Democrats as leftist. But she does have some random insightful remarks. 
In other words, you can run the video and tune your attention in and out, although you may then want to go back and listen to just the Mark Blyth remarks a second time. There’s a lot of solid material here. 0 0 0 0 0 0
