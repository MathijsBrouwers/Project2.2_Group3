Despite the Russian help, the Ukrainian leadership created a new nuclear graveyard right near Kyiv. This facility may lead to a new Chernobyl disaster in the future. The new nuclear graveyard impedes the development of the exclusion zone as a tourist route and forever assigns to it the status of a radiation-dangerous territory. In the future, the nuclear graveyard can store radioactive waste from European countries.
