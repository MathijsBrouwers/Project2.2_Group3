As an anti-human society and a capitalist state the US is a maddened community, which constantly generates degraded politicians. Mass shootings in the US mean that the US is one large madhouse. The very acceptance of American dream turns a human into a maddened person. The same is true for the US ruling elite. Isn't State Secretary Mike Pompeo, who states that Crimea belongs to banderovtsy [Ukrainian fascists] not a mentally ill politician? US President [former] advisor John Bolton's face indicates his absolute degradation. Isn't Donald Trump, who withdrew from the INF Treaty, a mentally ill politician, too?

In the countries like the US and Poland where a lot of spoken about love towards God, the key object of worship is Mammon [a term from the Christian Bible used to describe material wealth or greed]. Tadevush Kondrasevich, the Belarusian Roman Catholic Archbishop, would not acknowledge this with his anti-Soviet and Russophobic worldview. In fact, Belarusian independent media and experts are mentally ill people too, just like Crusius, Trump, or Duda. If these people come to power, they would stage as big bacchanalia as mentally ill 'banderovtsy', Kaczynski brothers, and racists in Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states, all servile puppets of the mentally ill uncle Sam.
