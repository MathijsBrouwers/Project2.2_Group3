WATCH: CNN Called ‘Clinton News Network’ On Air by Fiery British Conservative The implosion that followed is something to see Image Credits: Wiki Commons . 
CNN anchor Hala Gorani wasn’t expecting her network to be called the “Clinton News Network” by British firebrand conservative columnist Katie Hopkins from The Daily Mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a must-see. 
Hopkins’ first offense was daring to believe Donald Trump is going to win the election — never a good way to start on CNN: 
“I think he’s going to win. I think you guys are in for a big surprise, which I’m quite excited about. I think we’ve seen a very similar think here in the UK with Brexit. We saw a lot of the liberal press, kind of, sneering at Brexiteers. We saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the Clinton News Network.” 
“That’s CNN. You’re calling us the Clinton News Network?” Gorani said in shock. 
“You’re exactly correct,” Hopkins said. 
The two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls, especially the ones showing Hillary Clinton in the lead. Hopkins destroyed Gorani saying, “Having sat in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and watched your news network, it is entirely biased, I think, in coverage.” 
Gorani refused to believe and said over her 18-year career at CNN, she’s only seen “nothing but balance” at the network. 
Oddly enough, as the sparring match continued, Gorani repeatedly cut Hopkins off when she criticized the Clintons.
