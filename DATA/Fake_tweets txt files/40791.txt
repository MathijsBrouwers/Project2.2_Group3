The US accused Russia of being responsible for the sound attacks on US diplomats in Havana, Cuba. There is no evidence for such accusations, but the very clear reason is for the US to have the ultimate reason to seriously disrupt its relations with Russia. This media paranoia has one goal: to limit the possibilities of international trade, to break economic, cultural and other ties, to get all contacts to the level of the Cold War.
