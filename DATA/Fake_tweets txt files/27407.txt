HOUSTON, TX – Chambers County election officials have switched to emergency paper ballots after technical glitches with the electronic voting machines during early voting. Chambers County Clerk, Heather Hawthorne said electronic voting will be temporarily suspended until her office completes a software update. Reportedly, there was an error in the programming of Election Systems and Software, Inc. electronic voting machines. “The Straight Party vote for both the Republicans and Democrats did not automatically select one race on each ballot.” Hawthorne said she anticipates all technical difficulties to be addressed by the end of Tuesday. But until the issue is fully corrected, emergency paper ballots will be used. See the official press release below:
