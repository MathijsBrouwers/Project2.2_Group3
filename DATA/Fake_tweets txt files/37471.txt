The Resolution of the EU Parliament from September 18 [regarding the role of the USSR in the start of WWII] is a manifestation of anti-Russian activities. It is a part of the anti-Russian policy, which has been particularly present in Western Europe since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis. Possibly, if there was no crisis in Ukraine, this resolution wound not have existed. It is clear that this resolution on historical issues has a connection to the present day and to the current relations between Western Europe and Russia.
