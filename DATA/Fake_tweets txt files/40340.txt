Another lie from the notorious Western project “Bellingcat”, actively used by Georgian media to disseminate anti-Russian propaganda that pleased its foreign sponsors, almost caused a very real conflict. On November 1, information was circulated that Azerbaijani troops allegedly occupied part of Georgian territory near the junction of the borders of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. Other media picked up the story but without quoting its origin, causing alarm among Georgian citizens. Local media, even after realising that the Bellingcat news was an outright lie, chose to remain silent rather than dissipate fears. The discrediting of this anti-Russian resource was more unacceptable for them than alleviating panic.
