Petition to remove Megyn Kelly over 30k in just a few hours   Tweet 
Megyn Kelly is a news person with an agenda. Instead of reporting the news, she attempts to distort and manipulate facts to support her own agenda. Her latest victim is Donald Trump. A news source should not be trying to influence the American Voter. FOX professes to be fair and balance but Kelly loads her panels with those that support her views. This has become a typical FOX News ploy during these elections. Kelly needs to be removed from her position until she has learned the mantra “The facts, ma’am, just the facts.”
