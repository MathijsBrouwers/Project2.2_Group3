The prophecy is coming true. 
Every cuck loser who enters Trump’s proximity turns into a mega-shitlord. 
Newt Gingrich just taught the slut Megyn [sic] Kelly how to shut her whore mouth. 
Wow. 
Washington Post : 
Gingrich, on Fox in his role as a Donald Trump surrogate, had questioned the stories of women whoâve come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault â and the relative importance of the controversy itself, relative to Hillary Clintonâs alleged misdeeds. 
Kelly pushed back. âAs a media story, we donât get to say that 10 women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir,â said the Fox anchor. 
âSure. Okay,â Gingrich said. â So, so itâs worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton had a secret speech in Brazil to a bank that pays her 225,000 [dollars], saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America â thatâs not worth covering âŚ â 
âThat is worth covering,â interjected Kelly. âAnd we did.â 
Gingrich was still speaking: â âŚ I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently, you are fascinated with sex, and you donât care about public policy. â 
âMe? Really?â she said, laughing. 
âWell, thatâs what I get out of watching you tonight,â Gingrich said. 
Cue crosstalk. 
KELLY: âYou know what, Mr. Speaker, Iâm not fascinated by sex. But I am fascinated by the protection of women âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and understanding what weâre getting in the Oval Office âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and I think the American voters would like to know âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âAnd, therefore, weâre going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all, you are worried about sexual predators.â 
âYeah, listen, itâs not about me,â Kelly said. âItâs about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations and, in large part, believe that they are a real issue. And donât dismiss the women âŚâ 
And: resume crosstalk. 
GINGRICH: âYou want to comment, you want to comment âŚâ 
KELLY: â âŚ donât dismiss the women summarily.â 
GINGRICH: â âŚ on whether the Clinton â do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator.â 
KELLY: âWe on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered that story as well, sir. I will tell you, the polls âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âNo, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words âBill Clinton, sexual predator.â I dare you. [At that point, Gingrich was smiling slightly. Kelly was not.] âSay âBill Clinton, sexual predator.ââ 
KELLY: âMr. Speaker, weâve covered â excuse me, sir âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Iowa, by the Arkansas bar.â 
KELLY: âExcuse me. excuse me.â 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Arkansas bar. Eight hundred fifty thousand dollar penalty.â 
KELLY: â âŚ excuse me, sir. We on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered the Clinton matter as well. Weâve hosted Kathleen Willey âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âWell, try saying it.â 
KELLY: â âŚ weâve covered the examples of him being accused as well, but heâs not on the ticket. And the polls also show that the American public is less interested âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âHeâll be in the, heâll be in the East Wing.â 
KELLY: â âŚ in the deeds of Hillary Clintonâs husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump. Weâre going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.â 
GINGRICH: âAnd you, too.â 
I haven’t seen a bitch get shut down like this since the 80s. I thought he was going to reach through the screen and start slapping her around, OLD SCHOOL. 
I hate this bitch so, so much. 
She alone is proof that women should never, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the kitchen or speak with men who are not their husbands, fathers or brothers. 
Because really, as funny as this exchange was, it isn’t really about sex. If it was about sex, as Newt mentions, she could easily focus on Bill, who is a literal rapist. 
It is about sexism. 
Anti-male sexism by a feminist whore. 
Megyn [sic] Kelly should be in prison.
