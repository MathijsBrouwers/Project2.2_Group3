Man to say 'You can take the mask off now' numerous times today 01-11-16 AN OFFICE worker has confirmed plans to repeatedly tell workmates to take off their masks because it is no longer Halloween. Martin Bishop of Stevenage has said he will say it to literally every male co-worker at least once today, and in some cases twice or even three times. Bishop said: “It really is a funny line. I know for a fact everyone else thinks so too as they all laughed at it last year when I said it to them.” However he will only be saying it to male work colleagues as some of the female ones ‘might take it the wrong way’. Bishop added: “ I know women, t hey act like they can take a joke but deep down I know it would hurt their feelings, especially as there really are some ugly women who work in this office. “ I’d never say that to them, obviously. I’ve got far too much respect for them to do that.”
