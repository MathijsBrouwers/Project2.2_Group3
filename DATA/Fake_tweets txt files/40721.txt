The European Parliament's quota decisions contradict the "Convention on the Status of Refugees" adopted by all UN member states. Article 26 on Freedom of Movement states that "Each Contracting State shall allow refugees lawfully in their territory to choose a place of residence and move freely within its territory, subject to certain exceptions laid down in proceedings under the same circumstances as foreigners". This means that nobody, not even the European Parliament, should be able to redistribute refugees.
