Incredible. Just when you start to think that there is nothing more Obama could say to become more a dirt bag than he’s already proven himself to be, he goes and pulls something OFF THE CHARTS stupid! 
In his efforts to push Hillary into the White House he spoke at a recent rally for her. What he had to say, was an insult to American men. 
See for yourself! 
He says he wants to be honest? He lacks the integrity to do so. So basically when men don’t vote for Hillary, it’s not because they are intelligent enough to recognize she is a corrupt snake whose greed and hunger for money and power will leave our country hanging by a string. It’s not because they have a mind to think for themselves and decide whether she’s the person for the job or not. 
Nope…according to Obama, it’s because American men are racist. 
Infuriating..isn’t it? 
It’s just too much stupid, and we all know we shouldn’t engage with it because it will drag us down to its’ level and destroy us with experience in stupidity…but still. 
Sometimes I wish we could mute the stupid. Just long enough to regain our sanity back to endure through it. 
What an idiot.
