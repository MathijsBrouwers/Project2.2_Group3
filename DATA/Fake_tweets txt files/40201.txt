Patriarch Kirill and the Pope presented a joint statement on the escalation of the situation in Syria.

"The ongoing hostilities in the Middle East, which have caused great suffering in recent years, which have claimed the lives of many thousands of people and forced millions to flee, now threaten to escalate into a global conflict," he read the text of the statement.

In their opinion, "the world approached a dangerous line - to a real failure in international relations and cooperation, which was carried out for the benefit of the entire human family."

"In the face of this terrible threat, we appeal to all world leaders to realize their responsibility to their people, to humanity in general and to God," the statement stresses.

The Patriarch and the pontiff also appealed to the member states of the United Nations to recall their duty to the family of nations, to overcome differences and work together for the sake of world peace.

"Together we urge political leaders not to allow further escalation of tension, to avoid confrontation and to take the path of dialogue," spiritual leaders concluded.

In addition, the statement was supported by the heads of the Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem Orthodox churches, as well as several other patriarchs of the Eastern churches.

On April 14, the United States, Great Britain and France fired more than 100 missiles in Syria.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, called the West's attacks on Syria an act of aggression.
