Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation commented the statements of the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, General Jeffrey Harrigian, about a possible attack on Kaliningrad. The ministry emphasised that this region is reliably protected from any aggressive 'plans' that are being developed in Europe by 'random' American generals. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs flagged the statement of Harrigian as a "threat" and "irresponsible opinion".
