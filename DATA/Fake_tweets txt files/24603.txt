Half of the weapons that the international anti-terrorist coalition headed by the US drops from the air over Syria end up in the hands of the terrorist grouping known as the Islamic State, or Daesh, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated. 
“The question of fighting terrorism needs to be asked first and foremost to the West. We are now fighting against Daesh. The US periodically provides air support but, unfortunately, we see weapons of Western manufacturing in Daesh hands. Of course, the Americans don’t say that they are supporting Daesh, but we see that half of the weapons dropped from their aircraft go to Syrian Kurds, and the other half to Daesh,” the Turkish head of state said in an interview to Second Israeli TV channel. 

Ankara remains opposed to the US’ support for Syrian kurds.
