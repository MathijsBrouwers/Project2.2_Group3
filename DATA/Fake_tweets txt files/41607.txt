Over fifty thousand signatures have already been collected in Armenia against ratification of the Istanbul Convention.

Istanbul Convention provides broad rights to transvestites, homosexuals, lesbians and other perverts in Armenia. Under Article 60, by ratifying the Convention, the country is obliged to grant asylum to persons who were persecuted on the basis of sexual orientation. In the case of ratification of the Istanbul Convention, a flow of perverts is expected.

There is internal information that the initial number for the Republic of Armenia is 50,000. Therefore, after ratifying the document we are obliged to provide asylum to 50,000 people.
