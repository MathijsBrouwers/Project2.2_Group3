The Twitter bot ‘FBI Records Vault’ had not been in use for over a year, but suddenly released several documents on October 30. 
The FBI is now investigating the account, according to Judd Legum, editor of Think Progress . TP is a project of the Center for American Progress, the Democratic think tank founded by John Podesta, campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. 
The account’s puzzling activation was referred to the FBI’s Inspection Division for an “investigation” by Candice Will, the assistant director for the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Following the investigation, it will then be referred back to Will’s department for “adjudication,” according to Legum. 
A complaint is said to have been filed by Jonathan Hutson, a former employee of the Center for American Progress and a public-relations consultant, leading to the investigation. Post navigation
