Spetsnaz GRU: Russian special operations forces The Spetsnaz GRU was designed to carry out reconnaissance and sabotage activity on the enemy’s territory. By Boris Egorov , RIR Russia's Ministry of Defence 
Military special operation forces are elite units of the Russian Armed Forces. They are controlled by the Main Intelligence Agency (GRU) under General Staff. 
The primary function of special forces in wartime is infiltration behind enemy lines, usually well before hostilities are scheduled to begin and, once in place, to commit acts of sabotage (such as the destruction of vital communications logistics centers, the command posts for the guidance of nuclear weapons ), the assassination of key government leaders and military officers. 
Acting in groups of five to ten people, the Spetsnaz GRU is able to act autonomously for several days. 
Soldiers go through special physical and psychological training, in which special emphasis is placed on mastering the weapons, skill in radio communications, and knowledge of the enemy’s territory.
