'In recent years, Russophobia would take center stage in foreign policy designs of the United States.'

'And even though Frenchmen are always kin to fight for their rights even in the world where erosion of social security is now a global trend, it’s truly alarming that today’s protests across France bear all the attributes of a color revolution. And by this point, Washington has staged enough of those all across the globe to perfect its tools. And since Washington’s main goal is to remove Emmanuel Macron from power, it’s no wonder that protesters are chanting: “Macron must leave.”'

'It’s also particularly curious that any such provocation staged by the United States and Britain would typically be accompanied by a media campaign, aimed at distracting the public opinion from the real perpetrators of such protests. This time was no different, as Ukrainian intelligence agencies in a bid to please Washington tried to misguide French media sources into searching for a Russian trace behind the protests, but no evidence of Moscow having anything to do with it has been presented to them so far.'
