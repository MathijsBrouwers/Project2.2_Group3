The head of the Turkish Association of Eurasian Governments and confidant of the deputy head of Turkey’s General Security Directorate, Hasan Cengiz, has called for the choice of the Crimean people expressed in the referendum in 2014 to be recognized. 
Cengiz is the head of a delegation of Turkish politicians and business circle representatives that arrived in Simferopol from Moscow on Wednesday evening. The delegation includes 22 people, including a representative of the Turkish president, a participant in meetings between the Russian and Turkish presidents, Ibrahim Ereli, and the vice mayor of Ankara, Ahmet Tunc. 

Cengiz stated during a meeting with Crimean parliamentarians in Simferopol: “Crimea is home to around 2.5 million people. And the will of the people of Crimea led to Crimea reunifying with Russia. A very high percentage of voters in the referendum supported this. The people’s choice must be respected.”
