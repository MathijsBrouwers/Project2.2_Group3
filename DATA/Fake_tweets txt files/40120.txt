The press service of the Ministry of State Security of the Donetsk People’s Republic has reported that Ukrainian forces are preparing a provocation in Donbass which threatens the lives of an incoming EU delegation. The DPR’s ministry claims to have uncovered Ukrainian forces’ plans to use an Igla MANPAD to shoot down the delegation’s helicopter and blame the LPR and DPR. // The loudest act of terror of all those orchestrated by the Ukrainian authorities was the shooting down of Boeing MH17. The Malaysian Boeing’s targeting was the mistake of a Ukrainian pilot who mistook the passenger plane for President Putin’s.
