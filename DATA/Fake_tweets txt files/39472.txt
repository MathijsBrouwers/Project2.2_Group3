President Petro Poroshenko is preparing an armed provocation on the Ukrainian-Russian border. It will take place at the end of December. Kyiv coordinates such moves with Western curators and confidants. Poroshenko is being advised to keep the military actions low key, so that it is still possible to enact propaganda that the Russians are attacking Ukraine.
