Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery discuss the “Color Revolution” against Trump & the Jewish war against him and America! 
Today Dr. Duke had Dr. Patrick Slattery as his guest for the hour. They discussed the Soros & Company-fueled demonstrations that are going on in cities across the United States that bear a resemblance to the “color revolutions” that were used by Soros in several countries around the world to overturn the results of elections or overthrow governments that were not kosher enough. 
They talked about the media’s continuing attack on Trump. He granted an interview to 60 Minute’s Leslie Stahl, who constantly interrupted him, preventing him from answering the questions she posed to him. Trump importantly insisted that he will continue to by-pass the media and communicate directly with his supporters via social media. He also seemed to prioritize tightening the immigration law over immediately deporting all illegal aliens, which Doctors Duke and Slattery agreed was the proper strategy.
