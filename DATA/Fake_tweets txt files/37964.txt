In the face of its established tendency to accuse Moscow of meddling in elections, the EU has itself acknowledged that such charges are lacking in substance.

In a recent report, the European Commission admitted there is insufficient evidence to identify a "distinct cross-border disinformation campaign" in the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections. This, however, did not stop the Commission from alleging that unspecified "Russian sources" had attempted to influence their outcome.

This claim fits into the three-year campaign of baseless interference allegations which the US, France, the UK, Spain, and Germany have levied against Russia.
