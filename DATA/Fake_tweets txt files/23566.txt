Teacher unsure about getting smashed eighth night running 28-10-16 
A TEACHER unsure if he can manage an eighth straight night of drinking acknowledged that half-term gives him little choice. 
29-year-old secondary school teacher Tom Booker told friends that, despite the debilitating physical effects, he feels honour-bound to spend the last nights of his holiday drinking until 3am and sleeping in until 1pm. 
Booker continued: “It’s a job with responsibilities, and one of those responsibilities is making the most of a week off in October. 
“Some of my colleagues take walking holidays or pop to Center Parcs with the kids, but I’m single and not outdoorsy so I spend the week getting shitfaced. 
“Two more nights to get through, then on Sunday I have a big roast dinner and a bath and rock up Monday like I spent the whole time marking homework.” 
Booker added: “Plus one of the year 12 lads has been in the pub every night so far, so to maintain discipline in the classroom I need to show I’m more hardcore than he is.”
