Christians Martyred by ISIS: 1,131 In addition, at least 125 Christian churches had been attacked or destroyed by ISIS Michael W. Chapman | CNS News - October 27, 2016 Comments 
A report submitted to the State Department earlier this year documented that between 2003 and June 9, 2014, at least 1,131 Christians – identified by name and place of death – had been murdered by the radical Muslims that comprise the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. 
In addition, at least 125 Christian churches had been attacked or destroyed by ISIS. 
The report, Genocide Against Christians in the Middle East , was submitted to Secretary of State John Kerry on March 9, 2016 by the Knights of Columbus and the humanitarian group In Defense of Christians. Eight days later, March 17, Kerry officially declared that ISIS’s ongoing actions against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities constituted genocide. 
Britain, the European Parliament, the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Iraqi and Kurdish governments have also declared ISIS’s actions genocide.
