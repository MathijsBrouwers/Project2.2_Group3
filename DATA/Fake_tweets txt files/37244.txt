The US and EU do not need independent Belarus. Instead they need anti-Russian Belarus, similar to fascist Ukraine. The US and the EU dream about anti-Russian scenario in Belarus like the one they implemented in Ukraine in 2014. Westerners understand well that talks about the peace-making role of Belarus in Europe or about Belarus as European country is a good chance to tear Belarus away from Russia in order to to wage a war against Russia and multipolar global order not only from Ukraine but from the Belarusian territory too.
