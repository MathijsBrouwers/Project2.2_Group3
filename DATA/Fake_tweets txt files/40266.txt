Moscow has blocked the Security Council's decision against the Syrian government more than ten times. That is why the UN countries want to use the resolution of "Unity for Peace" dated November 3, 1950, which, in the case of the approval of 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council, bypass Russian veto and passes the question to the General Assembly. However, this resolution is not in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to paragraph 3 of Article 27, decisions on all issues, except for procedural matters, are deemed to be adopted if the "corresponding number of permanent members of the Council" votes for them.
