In case you haven`t heard, the FBI has reopened the email case that might put Hillary Clinton behind bars. When that news broke, Senate minorityleader Harry Reid immediately went after James Comey, director of the FBI, though it make not be what you think. Reid says he’s talked w/ top NatSec officials who say that Comey “possesses explosive information” about Trump’s ties to Russia 
According to Right Scoop : 
“In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,” he said. “I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public…and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.” 
“Your rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,” he said. 
Enter South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy… 
“Thank God he’s leaving is my initial reaction. My second reaction is I didn’t known Mormons use drugs.”
