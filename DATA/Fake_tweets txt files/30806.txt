Golly! Lou Dobbs blows the lid off the casserole dish, exposes Evan McMullin’s Mormon Mafia ties Posted at 1:11 am on October 27, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
As Twitchy reported, presidential candidate Evan McMullin received some exciting news last week when a poll conducted by Emerson College showed him leading both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. 
Utah typically isn’t a battleground state, but the Trump campaign dispatched Mike Pence there Wednesday to try to win back those voters who say they’re voting for McMullin. How exactly did a third-party candidate manage to put the state in play? 
There’s been plenty of chatter on the periphery of Twitter about the “Mormon Mafia” driving McMullin’s poll numbers in Utah, but it was a (now deleted) retweet by Fox Business Channel’s Lou Dobbs that got people talking about how a Mormon mafia would go about shaking down citizens for their votes.

A Mormon Mafia tool? That just doesn’t sound threatening at all. @LPDonovan @chrislhayes First I've heard of the Mormon Mafia. Is this a thing?

The tweet or the mafia? Both, apparently. @LPDonovan Mormon Mafia is legit.They've been running the green jello and caffeine-free Coke racket for years.
