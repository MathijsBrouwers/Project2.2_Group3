Tara Wood and her four-year-old daughter, Norah, were picking up her birthday cake at a local grocery story when they passed an older man. 
As her mom describes on Facebook, there was something that drew Norah to this specific gentleman. Her eyes lit up and she began waving: 
“Hi old person! It's my birthday today!” 
“Well hello little lady,” the man replied. “And how old are you today?” 
Tara admits to WSBTV that the man didn't look like the warmest man in the world — she was almost embarrassed when her daughter first called him over — but when the man realized Norah was talking to him, his face lit up. Loading Facebook Post... 
She says they carried on a small conversation and it was “super adorable.” Yet, when they said goodbye and went their separate ways, Norah realized she missed out on the opportunity to take a photo with her new friend. 
Tara turned around and tracked down the older gentleman — who they learned was named Mr. Dan — one more time. Loading Facebook Post... 
When they thanked Mr. Dan for taking some time out of his day to talk with them, it brought tears to his eyes: 
“No, thank YOU. This has been the best day I've had in a long time,” Mr. Dan said. “You've made me so happy, Ms. Norah.” 
According to WSBTV , Mr. Dan had lost his wife in March and he had sunk into a bit of a depression. 
What Tara didn't know is that those few words and that quick photoshoot would blossom into one the most adorable and purist friendships. That friendship would help Mr. Dan find a reason to get a haircut and shave again. Now the adorable and “magical” duo has lunch dates:
