Around 40,000 people are trapped in the refugee camp of Al Rukban, on the Syrian border with Jordan and inside the US-controlled area around the base of Al Tanf. US-backed armed groups operate there and are preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the camp, and people from leaving the area, despite the opening of two humanitarian corridors. They only let people to leave for exchange of huge amounts of money. Also, the US is obstructing the rescue operation by refusing to protect the convoy that should take the refugees out of the camp.
