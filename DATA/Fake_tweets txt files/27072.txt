November 13, 2016 Joe Rogan on coffee and cigarettes 
( INTELLIHUB ) — Physical addiction is “like a demon,” UFC Commentator Joe Rogan explained on a recent broadcast. 
During the broadcast Rogan pointed out just what the ‘demon of physical addiction’ likely sounds and looks like, going into character. 
Rogan’s guest said that he sometimes dreams about having a cigarette even though he has quit smoking. 
“I’ve had dreams about cigarettes and I wake up with a negative feeling and you’re like fuck, I’m god damn smoking again — it takes like twenty or thirty minutes to get the feeling out of me.” ©2016. INTELLIHUB.COM. All Rights Reserved.
