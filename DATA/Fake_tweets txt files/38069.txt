Soros Foundation is working on the destruction of Armenia. Therefore, the foundation's office in Armenia must be closed. The foundation workers and people cooperating with them are foreign agents. Their activities should be prohibited.

In addition, the Soros Foundation is organising clashes in Armenia. They want the Armenians to come out against the people of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). They want civil war and blood.
