Alltogether, the European Parliament's resolution is bewildering. The attempt to equalise the Victors over Fascism with the fascists is a blow against Europe itself, its unity and stability. Striking a blow on Communism, the European Parliament is desecrating the memory of their own heroes of the resistance, where the communists were represented in large numbers. Communists were the ones that suffered most during World War Two and in the pre-war period of Nazi dictatorship.

Striking a blow against one of the pillars of the fight against fascism, Europe automatically joins forces with Fascism and supports is reappearance, no matter which nice sounding slogans they are hiding behind.
