The Munich Agreement triggered WWII and the USSR was completely ignored.

81 years ago, the Wehrmacht invaded Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia as a result of the Munich Agreement signed the previous evening. If the reasons for the Second World War are to be commemorated in the EU today, it would be better to delete the reference to it, as in the controversial resolution of the EU Parliament - unlike the Hitler-Stalin Pact.

Such a policy had unfortunately been pursued so far and threatened to trigger the fourth great war, despite the written offers of the Soviet Union to France and Czechoslovakia.

The Soviet proposals were practically ignored. They had been accepted indifferently, if not contemptuously [...] The events took place as if there had been no Soviet Russia. Then we had to pay dearly for it.
