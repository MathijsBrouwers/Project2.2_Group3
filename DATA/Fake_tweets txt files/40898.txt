The officials of Ukraine said bluntly that ‘now, we "clean up" Kharkiv, "clean up" Odessa, "clean up" Donbas and get on with Crimea. This plan was announced repeatedly on various levels. They "cleaned up" Kharkiv, "cleaned up" Odessa bloodily and brutally, then went on to  Donbas and came across the resistance there! Therefore the peace in Crimea was established because they got stuck in Donbas.
