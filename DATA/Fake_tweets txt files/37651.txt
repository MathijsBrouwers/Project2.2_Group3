The Ukrainian secret service manipulated a sound recording in the MH17 investigation.

As an indication of the manipulation, the Malaysian expert mentions the noise level in the sound recording: "That is manipulated. The noise level differs from this audio track. See this soundtrack, the noise level differs in this part. It is lower here and higher here".

Audio parts had been cut together. There are also many sections that have been cut out. "That is clear, you can see that, the lack of parts of the audio recording," the analyst added.
