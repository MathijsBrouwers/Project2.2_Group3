The European Parliament has carried out a political hatchet job for Poland. On 13 October Poland is holding parliamentary elections, and most experts connect the signing of the European Parliament's resolution with the "Acute Autumn Symptom" of the Polish delegation to the EP. The current political leadership in Poland aims to demonstrate to the voters that they are defending the "historical boundaries" and fending off Russia.
