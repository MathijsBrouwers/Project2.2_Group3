Prime Minister Theresa May was directly deceiving the deputies, while talking about the Russian poisonous substance "Novichok". Deceiving, because there has never been such a poisonous substance in the world and never was: there has never been a project to develop this substance neither in the USSR nor in Russia. [...] It turns out that May invented herself such a substance – ‘Novichok’.
