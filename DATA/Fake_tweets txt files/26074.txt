(Table 9) Prec Metals= Mostly Silver 
JP Morgan = $16.7 Billion Citibank = $8.3 Billion 
Although those numbers may seems small in the grand scope of their total derivative positions (JPM = $53T & CITI = $50T) these are the only two banks listed on the report listing ANY silver derivatives! Also, with silver being so massively undervalued a 10x move would mean losses in the 100’s of billions for the silver shorts. (*you can add Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank to the list of silver derivative shorts in Europe!) 
Of course, the OCC reports on only US banks but the near fact that the two most dangerous banks in the world are the two holding the huge silver derivative positions is a clear indication that SILVER MANIPULATION GAME MAY EXPLODE AT ANY MOMENT! 
Stay tuned for more on this in the coming weeks/months as their game goes sideways. 
May the Road. you choose be the Right Road.

PS – IF Donald Trump actually makes it to Jan 20th and gets sworn in as our next President then he will be in charge of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and can pull the plug on the Global Market Rigging Operation at the moment of his choosing. 
Let’s pray he makes it that far as the “forces of darkness” (aka The Bad Guys) are clearly lining up to stop him from taking office. Help us spread the ANTIDOTE to corporate propaganda. Please follow SGT Report on Twitter & help share the message. Related
