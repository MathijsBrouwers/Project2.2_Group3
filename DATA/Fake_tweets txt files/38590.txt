For the anniversary of NATO the foreign ministers of the member countries met. In the program of festivities, the enemy of always: Russia of course. NATO is again brandishing the so-called Russian threat, this time in the Black Sea in order to further militarise this region of the world.


Moscow does not welcome NATO's willingness to increase its presence on the ground and, above all, does not see the point to such actions. NATO refers to the 2018 incident in which three Ukrainian military ships were arrested by the Russian authorities in the Strait of Kerch. Moscow then denounced a provocation. This is a violation of key provisions of international law, including of the UN Charter which impose respect of the sovereignty of other states. Military surveillance, chartering ships, all this is very expensive. 

The financial contribution of the European member states of NATO is not up to Donald Trump's expectations. It is precisely by creating these kinds of Russian threats that Washington hopes it will get its allies to invest more money.
