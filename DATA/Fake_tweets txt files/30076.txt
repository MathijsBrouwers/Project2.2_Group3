well clinton is a fool if she does not seek to restore relations with russia ASAP…they seem to be forgetting about ''the dead man's switch" it's an actual system implimented by russia as a warning to it's enemies of nuclear retaliation….why the fuck is america's citizens letting their leaders destroy peaceful relations with russia.. even if russia would lose a war against usa the problem is the aftermath….we're talking millions dead if not billions and nuclear fallout on a global scale﻿
