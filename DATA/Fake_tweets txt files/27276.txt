Trump has made it clear that not even committing sexual assault would make him withdraw from the election. 
This latest video is one of many being unearthed, including one in which he said he’d be dating a ten-year-old girl in another ten years. But this isn’t the first time he’s made sexual comments about Ivanka: “If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father…” 
The latest tape shows the father and daughter duo appearing on an episode of the Wendy Williams Show back in 2013. During a segment called Fave 5, Wendy asked what their favorite thing to bond over was. 
Ivanka gave an eloquent response: “Either real estate and golf.” 
Her father’s, who is currently holding rallies in swing states while continuing to claim the election is rigged, had less to do with career and sports and more to do with his objectification of women: “Well I was gonna say sex, but…” 
There’s also a video from 1994 in which Trump sexualized his other daughter, Tiffany Trump , when she was a one-year-old. Tiffany is the only child between him and his second wife, Marla Maples . “Well, I think that she’s got a lot of Marla, she’s a really beautiful baby, and she’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know yet if she’s got this part yet.” 
As he said that, Trump then held his hands to his chest and suggested breasts. That wasn’t the only cringe-worthy moment pertaining to him and Tiffany, though. Donald Trump and Tiffany duck each other's kisses after presidential debate he refused to kiss Tiffany interesting https://t.co/CFrIs8xdL7
