The new "Rail Baltica" is a measure to build up military infrastructure in the Baltic States.

By 2026, a railway track is to be built in the Baltic States on which NATO-tanks can be quickly and directly moved to the Russian border.

The West is consistently expanding the military infrastructure in the Baltic States. There is no doubt that the new railway will be built for military purposes. Rail Baltica is the central element of an infrastructure network for the rapid deployment of military troops.

Currently more time is needed to transport "tanks to protect against aggressive Russia". But on the new Rail Baltica "the tanks will arrive faster" at the Russian border.
