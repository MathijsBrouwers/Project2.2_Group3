Comments Barack Hussein Obama’s half-brother Malik Obama has become a thorn in the president’s side during this election as he has turned on his family by publicly supporting Donald Trump for president. The Gateway Pundit reported that Malik posted a video of himself wearing a Trump hat on Twitter to prove that his account is real. Watch as Malik tells his followers to “vote Trump,” something we never thought we’d hear an Obama say! 
— MicroSpookyLeaks™ (@WDFx2EU7) October 27, 2016 Trump made headlines a few weeks ago when he invited Malik to the second presidential debate as his guest. Western Journalism reported that Malik has been an outspoken Trump supporter throughout this election. “I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,” he said. “‘Make America Great Again’ is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.” As for Trump, he’s very excited to meet Malik as well. “I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,” Trump said. “He gets it far better than his brother.” Malik was once a Democrat, but he’s said that foreign policy missteps and social concerns have caused him to move to the Republican side. He has also said he distrusts Hillary Clinton, citing her scandals and dishonesty, which he says have only gotten worse since he originally voiced his support for Trump. “I don’t like [Hillary] Clinton,” Malik said in September, in spite of his half-brother’s proud endorsement. “She is dishonest and a liar. She keeps on lying about emails every time.” Malik has slammed Clinton’s performance as Secretary of State, pointing out that she inflamed chaos and violence in the Middle East.
