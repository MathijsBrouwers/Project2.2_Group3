Crimea is seen as part of Russia, from which it thus cannot legally secede. Crimea ended up being included in the Ukrainian SSR only based on the "voluntary decision" by Nikita Khrushchev. Up to this point, it (Crimea) had been perceived exclusively as a Russian territory. And in 2014 the peninsula joined the Russian Federation on the basis of a referendum in which the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of the peninsula took part. And now it will not be returned to Ukraine or any other country.
