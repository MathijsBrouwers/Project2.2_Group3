Stoicism is a philosophy for your mind that helps you deal with suffering and misfortune. In this podcast, I review stoicism’s strongest points as presented by three powerful thinkers (Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius) by using direct quotes from their most important works. I also share how I’ve used stoicism to reduce pain in my own life and how you can do the same through an effectively four-point strategy.
