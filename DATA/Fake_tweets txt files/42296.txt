Polish MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke draws attention to the threat of the outbreak of a third world war. As a proof of the impending war, he points out the US debt, which he thinks is similar to the German national debt before World War II. He also points out the announcement of the alliance between China and Russia against NATO, the declaration of Slovak Prime Minister that within a month the third world war should break out, or the fact that that Russian propaganda is getting stronger.
