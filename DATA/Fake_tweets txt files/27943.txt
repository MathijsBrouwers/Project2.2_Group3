Hostility toward women is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support Vox (ChiGal) 
Seems rather obvious – so would “Hostility toward men is one of the strongest predictors of Hillary support”. Neither sentence makes a conclusion about what percentage of bigots in either group. 
One other thing I find odd is the chart for Romney vs. Trump. Unless I’ve missed something about Obama being a woman cross-dressing, then Romney wasn’t running against a woman, so anyone having said bias as their primary motivator for decision making would have had to look further down their decision logic tree to secondary motivators to decide which ballot lever to pull. There is very little interest in rigor in political science or social science.
