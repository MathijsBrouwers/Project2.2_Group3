Poland plays the role of a “banana republic” in its alliance with the United States. This country is allowing the hegemon to take advantage of it, without being forced to. The behavior of the American Ambassador in Poland may be described in colonial or post-colonial categories – “she behaves like a Governor of an area, which can be exploited. The locals have some legal regulations preventing such exploitation, so it is necessary to do something about it, for example, using blackmail”.
