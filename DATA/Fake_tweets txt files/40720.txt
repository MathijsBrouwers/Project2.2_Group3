According to a municipality spokesman, the French capital wants the Champs-Élysées to focus on the aesthetic and cultural dimension in the Christmas season, reflecting the uniqueness of the location. Marcel Campion, who has been organizing this Christmas market since 2008, has prevented the deterioration of the quality of the markets, and he does not understand why the city management has decided to cancel them. It is strange that the city organizes a celebration of Ramadan but will not organize one simple Christmas market.
