The West has a powerful arsenal of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, which has become a serious threat to the international security.


All colour revolutions have the same 'modus operandi'.

Then a country that suffers from the coup becomes dependent on the outside, which ruins its economy, impoverishes the population and triggers crime and abuse.
