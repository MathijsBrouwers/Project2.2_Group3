In the winter of 2013-2014, the Maidan Revolution in Kyiv ousted former President Viktor Yanukovich who had refused to ratify an association agreement with the European Union, getting closer to  Vladimir Putin's Russia. A diplomatic disaster for Europe: Washington and Brussels proposing such an agreement actually forced Ukraine to choose a side, pushing the country to a civil war, while it had been a buffer between the West and Russia until then.

The conflict turned into a disaster for the Ukrainian army. But how was this possible? How could a region of 3 million people and its army of 10-15,000 insurgents stand up to a country of 40 million and its 150,000 soldiers? Do not forget that the people of Donbas defend their home, their land, their history, their heritage.

One must understand one thing Russia absolutely did not want this war in Donbas. One thing is certain, it was not the Russians who provoked this war.
