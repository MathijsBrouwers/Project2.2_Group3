We have on @BrettPain and @MurderBryan from Street Fight Radio on WCRS in Columbus, Ohio to discuss what’s next for those of us on the left following this absolutely crushing defeat at the hands of the extreme right-wing. It’s definitely a cathartic conversation, but we don’t just vent, we discuss next steps for building a powerful counterweight to right-wing demagoguery. Liberalism and sectarian leftism have failed. We can’t keep blaming everyone else, this defeat requires some serious introspection from liberals and leftists alike. If you are unable to organize people to your political position, that’s your fault, not the fault of those you fail to convince.
It’s time for those of us on the Left to get it together. No one else is going to fix this for us.
