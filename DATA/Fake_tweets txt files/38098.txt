According to the findings of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which has been investigating the disaster since 2014, the aircraft was attacked with a ground-to-air missile of the Buk series. JIT recently published a new report stating that the missile was fired from an area controlled by the [Donetsk Republic's] People's Militia. The rocket is said to have been brought there from Russia.

However, this data contradicts the results of more than 100 field experiments of the Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey, who has even destroyed a disassembled aircraft with a rocket in the course of their own investigations. The arms company accused investigators of ignoring important technical data of the rocket and of adapting their conclusion to an already prefabricated opinion.
