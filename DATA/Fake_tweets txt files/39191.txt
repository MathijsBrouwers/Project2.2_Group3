How can we discuss the territorial integrity of Ukraine, where the power belongs to fascists and terrorists? When the US and EU speak that violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity are unacceptable, this is the same as to agree that violations of territorial integrity of Hitler's Germany were unacceptable either. This logic implies that Adolf Hitler had the same right of appeal to international principles of Reich's territorial integrity as present-time Ukrainian fascists. The thing is that the US needs Ukraine as a battlefield against Russia. Ukraine's integration with the EU is a camouflage of external governance over it by the US and EU.
