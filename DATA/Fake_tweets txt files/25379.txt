Politics, said Katie Oldenburg, is like an ex-boyfriend — you don’t bring it up on the first date. 
Or so it used to go. This historically divisive election year has prompted Oldenburg, a 29-year-old public relations specialist who lives in New York City, to make a new dating rule: no Donald Trump supporters. 
“Talking about politics on a first date is a big no-no,” she said. “But given the state of affairs and how awful things have been, I’ve made a conscious effort to try and determine if I’m on the same page as whomever I’m dating at the time.” 
She added: “Just because Donald Trump’s comments have been so repulsive and disgusting that I don’t even want to be on a date with somebody who supports that person.” 
Trump and his demagogic presidential campaign have proven to be a major friction point in friendships, family relationships and even some marriages, as Americans grapple with one of the ugliest, most polarizing elections in American history.
