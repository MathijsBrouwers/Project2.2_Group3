Yes, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained a Secret Protocol that divided Poland in two. However, if Germany had not attacked Poland, the Protocol would have become void.

If we imagine that this pact between Germany and the USSR had not been signed, the German-Polish war would have started in any case because of the deadlock in the mutual relations.
