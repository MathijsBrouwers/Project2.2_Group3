Világyfigyelő reported that Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said English-speaking specialist had arrived to Idlib, who would then stage a chemical attack against the civilian population there "within two days." Konashenkov said that the attack would take place in the town of Kafer-Zait. Vilagfigyelo added that the attack will be blamed on the Assad regime.

Konasenkov added that Washington and his allies are preparing another aggressive step, which is evidenced by the fact - for example - that on August 22, representatives of the US, UK and France said that they would respond "as determinedly as possible" if the Syrian government wanted to use chemical weapons. According to Konashenkov, there was "no basis" for this statement.
