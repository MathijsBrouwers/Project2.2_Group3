Elitists Will Reap Grapes of Wrath Michael Moore speaks the truth, but won't support Trump The Alex Jones Show - October 28, 2016 Comments

He knows that we know who, how and why the elites destroyed our economic life. 
But he misses the optimism of Americanism and he turns a blind eye to Hillary’s corruption.
