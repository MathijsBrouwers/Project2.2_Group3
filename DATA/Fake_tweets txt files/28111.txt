Divergent 3D showcased its Blade Supercar, the world’s first highway-safe, 3D-printed supercar, during a press and dealers’ preview ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday. 
The vehicle boasts 700-hp motor, weights 1,400 lbs (635 kg), and is able to reach 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds, according to manufacturer. Apart from that, Blade has 1/3 the emissions of an electric car and 1/50 the factory capital costs of other manufactured cars. 
Kevin Czinger, CEO of Divergent 3D, says ‘this is the first car that’s actually a real car that can be taken on a highway that can be safety certified as a fully safe highway car… It’s going to be a 21st century revolution in manufacturing.’
