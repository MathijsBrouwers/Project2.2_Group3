In Syria and northern Iraq there is evidence about the first stages of the emergence of ISIS in 2003 and 2005. The Americans do not want this evidence to fall into the hands of others because it illustrates the participation of Saudi Arabia and [...] American and non-American private bodies in the first stage of the establishment of the Islamic State. The Americans are creating chaos in certain places to allow special forces to enter and evacuate the evidence from the area.
