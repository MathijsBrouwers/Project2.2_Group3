That is, around this war, there is a lot of hypocrisy in Donbas. But as for the Civil War, it always happens in this way. And this is a Civil War.
If there are many Russians [Russian soldiers in Ukraine], where are they? They should be in captivity at least proportionally somehow. Right? At least, proportionally. How many of them are there? Do you want to name the figure for 3 years of the war? 14 (I mean citizens). Fourteen.
Well, there was the Spanish Civil War earlier and you could also ask: what a Civil War was there? It was an occupation because Franko's Army was actually supplied with and its main combat forces were squadrons, primarily of Germanic and German pilots. The government, the legitimate government, it concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union, accordingly, our pilots were there. [Comrade] Stern was famous. Then, our tankmen. The ‘guy from our city’. But it was a Civil War. Yes, the war stimulated by other states that ignited and looked for their gains, but it was a Civil War.
