War preparations of fascists against Russia are clearly visible today, just as they were clearly visible in 1940. The US-led NATO is bringing its forces close to the Russian border. Romania, Poland, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Turkey, Greece and Japan are not US neighbours, yet they are full of the fascist US-forces and its allies. The US's goals are the same Hitler's Germany had, namely world domination over the peoples of the Earth with its economic and military might.
