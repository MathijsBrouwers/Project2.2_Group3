In the last days of 2018, the hacker group known as "The Dark Overlord" announced that it had stolen thousands of documents proving the involvement of the US government in the 9/11 attacks, in exchange for which they requested 2 million dollars. After not receiving the payment, they crowdfunded and published the first two batches of documents. But nothing else has been heard from The Dark Overlord for more than a month, so there are two options: either they got the money from the US government, or they were silenced by other means.
