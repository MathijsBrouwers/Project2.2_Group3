Forest brothers were Nazi collaborators. In Lithuania they exterminated 25 thousand people. In modern terminology they would be called terrorists. They started fighting the Red Army for the sake of the Third Reich and continued after the war, except their master changed, it was Great Britain and the USA.

We are told stories about bloody Stalin's regime, but how come we see these healthy old people if the regime supposedly exterminated everyone? That means the regime was not bloody and was very humane to those, whom we can call terrorists.

In Lithuania they are trying to find heroes for the young people. And it is either military heroes who fought fascism in the Red Army, or those who fought with fascism against the Red Army. There are no other heroes. Since the main ideology in the Baltic States is Russophobia, they take fascists for heroes. The West is pretending that they are some abstract fighters for abstract freedom. They are criminals, terrorists and killers.

The doctrine that Lithuania is the victim of Russian aggression and Russian occupation spreads in academic, public and political levels. This is how killers become heroes. Lithuanian schoolchildren have trouble remembering national history and are proud of the exploits of so-called "partisans". But no Lithuanian textbook now contains information about the bloody terror and civil war. How partisans killed civilians, not excluding women and children. They were not partisans, they were bandits.

In Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia tens of thousands of people died at the hands of forest brothers.

In Latvia forest brothers are also heroes and chekists are evil. No one remembers that soviet soldiers arrived because the bandits terrorised villagers.
