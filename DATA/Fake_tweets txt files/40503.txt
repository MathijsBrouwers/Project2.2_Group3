President of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy Laura Boldrini and Senate Speaker Pietro Grasso openly support the Ukrainian Nazis that every day kill innocent people in Donbass.

Boldrini and Grasso condemning the shooting on migrants in Italy's Macerata, [where the gunman had a right-wing background],Â  is a sign of hypocrisy as they themselves are friends with Andriy Parubiy, leader of Ukrainian Nazis.
