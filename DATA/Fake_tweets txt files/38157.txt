The Polish right wages historical war not only against Russia and the Red Army, but against history in general. It is difficult to understand why they fight obvious historical facts. They do not like the fact that Poland was liberated by the Red Army; they try to discharge Poland from the anti-Hitler coalition, create strange constructs of occupation, a second occupation, and the anti-Communist uprising.
