The White Helmets are plotting a new false-flag chemical attack in Syria's Idlib. The Western-backed, pseudo-humanitarian group will then pin the responsibility on the Syrian government.

Last March, the 'civil defence' organisation cooperated with the intelligence services of France and Belgium to stage a similar provocation in the same area. In April 2018, the group staged a chemical attack in the city of Douma.
