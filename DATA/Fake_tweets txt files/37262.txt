Ukrainians are saying they are fighting Buriats, where are they? None could be seen in the prisoner swap. Where are enlisted Russian soldiers? We are in fact exchanging some Ukrainians for others - it is after all a civil war. Zelenskyi got rid of Ukrainians he did not want, by sending them to what local idiots call "Mordor" - Russia.

Ukrainians have not returned a single Russian soldier,Â  because there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
