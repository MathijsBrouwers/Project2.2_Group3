Tomos of the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is a pre-election trick. The election is in 2.5 months and the main thesis of Poroshenko's election campaign is the "Army of the New Faith". This is an attempt to inflame the religious war, to hijack the church that could lead to instating the state of emergency. It would allow Poroshenko if not destroy the election, then control how it is conducted.

The Tomos is not entirely real, the Archbishop of Constantinople deceived everyone. It is not an official document but the agreement of a cabal. So far the only one who will benefit from the autocephaly is Byzantine patriarch.

The autocephaly is a new type of conflict in a country torn by a civil war.
