The exclusion of Russia from Winter Olympics has been done in order to humiliate Russia on the anniversary of the Soviet counter-offensive near Moscow during WWII and avenge the victories of Russia at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. This is proven by the date of the announcement; December 5 - the day of the beginning of the Soviet troops’ counter-offensive near Moscow, in 1941 during WWII. It is done symbolically, to try to humiliate Russia.
