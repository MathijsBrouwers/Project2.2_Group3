A man reads various quotes to people on the street that are either from Adolf Hitler or Hillary Clinton, and the participants are expected to guess which one it is.
First quote:
“We’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.”
The participants guessed Hitler. Nope. It was Hillary.

Second quote:
“I believe the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role.”
The participants guess Hitler. Nope! Wrong again! That was Hillary’s quote.
