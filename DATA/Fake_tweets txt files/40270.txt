The number of Croatian extermination camp victims during WWII was at least 700,000 and not just 100,000, as the West and Wikipedia put it. It is a sign that the West is waging war against all, against Russia, the Jews, the Serbs and the Christians. The Russians betrayed the Serbs, and the West is now doing what they want with the country and its history, so Russia has to endure and not give up on Syria.
