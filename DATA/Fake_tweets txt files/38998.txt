Ukraine is preparing another provocation in the Kerch Strait. Such a provocation would help initiate new sanctions against Russia and increase Poroshenko's ratings ahead of the election. The provocation would help make an unpopular candidate popular. Poroshenko will impose martial law, postpone elections, and start looking for "Moscow agents" to destroy his political competitors.
