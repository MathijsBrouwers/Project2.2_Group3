Well, this escalated quickly: NYT report on new emails now notes that “one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands” https://t.co/OUDPcphwx0 
From the New York Times : 
WASHINGTON — A new trove of emails that appear pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was discovered after the F.B.I. seized at least one electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday. 
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands — potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. 
And don’t expect any information on what the FBI finds until after the election, natch: NEW: Review of new emails — there are possibly thousands — anticipated to extend beyond Election Day, sources tell @jeffpeguescbs .
