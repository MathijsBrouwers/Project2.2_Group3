It’s hard not to think “frail old lady” when you think of Hillary Clinton, but today, she proved that she’s still got a little spring in her step: Reporters seeking comment on the email investigation got only a quick wave from @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/0m87gIOY8c

So, is that what it takes to get her movin’? @TimRunsHisMouth @anna12061 amazing how fast she can haul it when she's trying to avoid the press finally asking her relevant questions. 
Just look at her go! @TimRunsHisMouth Suddenly got a rush of #STAMINA 
— Sellrite Deals (@SellriteDeals) October 28, 2016 @TimRunsHisMouth AMAZING SHE WAS ALMOST RUNNING 
— NOBODY HOME ON LI !! (@shadozmom) October 28, 2016 @TimRunsHisMouth The amazing part is that she was able to get in without help.

And look glamorous doing it. Thanks, apparently, to a photoshoot she’d wrapped up just moments earlier: It appears Clinton was doing an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot when the FBI news broke #2016 https://t.co/dofjBK6t9i

Oh, how fun! Clinton delay on tarmac wasn't about the FBI, it turns out. Pool report notes that Annie Leibovitz came off after, likely had a photo shoot. pic.twitter.com/xE5pm3ITRC
