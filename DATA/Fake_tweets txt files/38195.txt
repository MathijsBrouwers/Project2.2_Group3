The present ruling elites of the West follow many concepts of Nazi Germany. They continue considering the people of Russia and other post-Soviet countries as Untermenschen ("racially inferior" people) and the Eurasian space as Lebensraum ('living space'). In this light, there is no difference between Hitler's concept of a New Europe and the present European Union. The EU remains the Europe of capitals and elites, not the Europe of the people. The destruction of the USSR, NATOâ€™s expansion to the East, banderovshchina ('fascist regime') in Ukraine and the revival of neo-Nazism in the Baltic states - all these are manifestations of an old West's 'Drang nach Osten' (Drive to the East) policy.
