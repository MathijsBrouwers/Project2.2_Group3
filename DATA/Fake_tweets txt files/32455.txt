Trump shocked to discover women can vote 08-11-16 DONALD Trump is furious after discovering that women can vote in elections. The Republican candidate was at a last-minute rally when he remarked on how it was lucky that ‘they’ couldn’t vote. However an aide then informed him that the US has enjoyed full female suffrage since 1920. After a brief explanation of what suffrage means, Trump said: “Even the fat and old ones? How many of their votes count as one man-vote? “I would not have said a lot of that shit had I known this. God damn it all to hell.” He added: “You know some of them can do magic too? That’s why they used to make them go and live in caves.”
