The referendum in Crimea on "returning to the Russian Federation" was actually held when Ukraine did not exist as a state from a legal point of view. During 20 Feb 2014 - 25 May 2014, Ukraine "de iure" did not exist due to the coup d'etat. In order to recognise the referendum results, the West would have to recognise the coup d'etat in Kiev.
