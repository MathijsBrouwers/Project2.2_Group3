The levels of sovereignty and independence of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent Countries, Eurasian Economic Union, or the Collective Security Treaty Organisation are much larger than of the NATO or EU countries. What would happen to any NATO country which dares to oppose the US's intention to station a military base on its territory?

The US does not have partners, all are subordinates. The West does not have a partnership culture. It sees other civilisations as those which have to be taught how to live. The British guidelines of communication with the aboriginal people read: if others do not get it, speak louder. This is the Western way of dealing with other countries.
