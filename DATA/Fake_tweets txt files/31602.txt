A CBS Denver voter fraud investigation has exposed dozens of cases in the state ahead of the November 8th presidential election.
According to CBS4, they discovered dozens of irregularities during their ongoing investigation such as ballots cast by the deceased and individuals voting twice. CBS4 explains that they have additionally found individuals voting in Colorado as well as other states in the same election cycle, this of course all at a time where the fear of voter fraud weighs heavily in the minds of the American electorate.

In six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle.
“You’d be surprised how often people double vote,“ said Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. “Two of the cases are serial double voters. I think people discover they can get away with it and keep doing it.”
Kobach says his office is “aggressively prosecuting” double voting cases because it’s a crime that “can’t be caught ahead of time.”
