From a legal point of view, there were no grounds for withdrawing the status of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA because last year, the agency successfully passed WADAâ€™s audits twice and it was recognised as one of the best in the world in its indicators. Therefore, RUSADA's status was temporarily suspended on a formal far-fetched pretext. All databases and test tubes were transferred back to WADA in early 2019. Further studies were conducted without a Russian presence, contrary to international legal procedures, which makes the decision illegal, unreasonable and requires an objective review by the International Sports Arbitration Court.
