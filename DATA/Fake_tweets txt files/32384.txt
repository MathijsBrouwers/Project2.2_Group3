Project Veritas: Bartender who recorded Romney’s 47 percent speech was part of ‘coordinated operation’ Posted at 11:14 pm on October 26, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
As Twitchy reported, James O’Keefe on Tuesday teased a new Project Veritas video that would ensure Americans United for Change director Brad Woodhouse a “busy busy day.” 
That video premiered on Fox News’“The O’Reilly Factor” Wednesday night. Remarkably, Scott Foval, fired from Americans United for Change after previous Project Veritas video releases, had even more secrets to offer up — and this one was big. . @oreillyfactor breaks new video showing @woodhouseb / Scott Foval was responsible for @DavidCornDC video, not "bartender" pic.twitter.com/IxpfHdqpB6

In Wednesday’s video release, Foval explains that the bartender who caught Romney’s devastating “47 percent” remarks on video during a fundraiser was part of a coordinated operation to sneak a video recording device into the event. That video eventually was passed along to David Corn of Mother Jones, who won a George Polk Award for his efforts.

The story at the time, of course, was that bartender Scott Prouty brought a camera along in hopes of perhaps getting a photo with Romney — which somehow involved setting down the camera and hitting the record button. Progressives hailed Prouty as a hero for coming forward with the video: It's up to us to keep the wolves from tearing up Scott Prouty, who did the right thing without any desire to be in the limelight.
