Aware of ongoing disagreements, the EU has intensified its efforts to bring even larger discord in Russia-Belarus relations by continuing to provide financial assistance to Belarus' civil society. The EU will use the same methods of colour revolutions that it has already applied in many other Eurasian countries. Support to the youth, scientific community and NGOs as well as nationalists will remain the EU priority. The information war is another important element to control zombie Belarusians and make them organise a Maidan.
