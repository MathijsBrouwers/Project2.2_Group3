Pennsylvania's incumbent Republican Senator Pat Toomey and his supporters have regularly accused Democratic challenger Katie McGinty of leading a “revolving door” career in politics and government. 
Toomey's campaign released an ad in April accusing McGinty of allocating “millions of tax dollars to benefit corporations” during her time in the state government. 
The Club for Growth PAC also used the “revolving door” line of attack against McGinty, calling out her career of maneuvering between lobbying and public service. 
So when McGinty attempted to enter a building that only had literal revolving doors while being followed by a tracker for the conservative Super PAC America Rising, she tried to find a way around a potentially bad photo op. 
McGinty can be seen in the video uploaded Tuesday pausing at multiple entrances and attempting to look for another way in the building. 
But after pacing back and forth to look for an alternative entrance, McGinty ultimately caved and entered through the revolving door.
