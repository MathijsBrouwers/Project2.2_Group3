The Ukrainian coup d'etat cost the US nothing or nearly nothing. After the coup, Ukraine came under the direct governance of US vice-president Joe Biden. When the previous US presidential administration was tearing Ukraine from the Russian sphere of interest, it must have felt a surge of adrenaline and endorphin. Obama thought he nearly tore Ukraine from Russia and interrupted brotherly ties between Ukrainians and Russia, something that no one did in the past, neither Charles XII of Sweden, nor German Emperor Wilhelm II, nor Adolf Hitler. Good relations between Ukraine and Russia were the obstacle for the US to get fertile Ukrainian soil under control.
