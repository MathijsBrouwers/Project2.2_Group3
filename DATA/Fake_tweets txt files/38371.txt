On the eve of Belarus' elections, the country is becoming an epicentre of Western struggle to control Eastern Europe. The level of competition over Belarus is linked to the weakening of the West and a revival of Russia's military and political strength. Faced with systemic crisis, the West desperately needs a success story. This explains why the West's interest toward Belarus is the highest today. The latest Western success story was a coup d'Ã©tat in Ukraine which happened a result of mass protests under the motto of European choice. Belarus' turnaround would become an even more conclusive evidence of the remaining might and attractiveness of the Euro-Atlantic space.
