The main blow against Russia will be made in 2021, in connection with the parliamentary elections. There are no doubts whatsoever about it. All that is going on is just rehearsals. After all, the parade of the "opposition", ranging from professional "protestutes" against anything in the world, via seasoned clients of the US Embassy like Navalny and his crowd, to the freak-show of possessed shamans - all this are only the casting. An attempt to select those, who in two years will be transformed into "great thinkers" and, hence, moving the "revolution" forward; a revolution that finally, to the joy of Washington and its allies, will erase the Russian statehood from the face of the earth.
