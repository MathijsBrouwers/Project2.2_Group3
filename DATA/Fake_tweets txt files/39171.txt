In a more confined sense, the Russian World consists of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, three nations belonging to Russian people. In a wider sense, the Russian world is the whole post-Soviet space and largely the past USSR allies. Without integration in humanitarian and political spheres, economic integration between Belarus and Russia will not be durable. Belarusian opposition financed by the West does everything to tear apart Belarus from Russia. This has already been done in Ukraine-Russia relations. Ukraine is externally governed by the US and the West, Ukrainians are used to fight Russia. Hence they struck in the Russian Words' heart. The Western governments are imposing their rules all over the world through colour revolutions.

The Belarusian authorities should legally challenge all activists who do not advocate for the Union State between Belarus and Russia and serve the interests of the US and the West instead. In doing so, concerns of the so-called international community should be disregarded. The Western countries should revoke their Russophobic and anti-Soviet legislation first. Belarus should also introduce the "foreign agent" concept just as Russia did.
