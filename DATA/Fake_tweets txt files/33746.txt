Man at dinner party may be leader of the Liberal Democrats 28-10-16 
A SMARTLY-DRESSED man at a posh dinner party may well be Tim Farron, fellow guests have realised. 
Suspicions began to grow that the man, who is in his mid-40s and of average height and weight, was the leader of a minority political party between the main and pudding courses. 
Julian Cook of Devizes said: “He’s a Tim, but that doesn’t mean anything by itself. There are lots of Tims. 
“But when I asked what he did for a living, he replied ‘Aside from the obvious?’ and told me actually it’s a very demanding position despite what happened last year, which left me no nearer. 
“He does know Nick Clegg. Still, I suppose so do lots of people.” 
Susan Traherne, who hosted the party, admitted she has known Tim since university but has never really been sure of his occupation. 
She said: “He was planning to go into politics but I never heard anything else about it so assumed he’d given up on the idea. But the orange tie, the general hopelessness, I should’ve figured it out. 
“I’ve a dreadful feeling I was slagging off the Lib Dems in the kitchen earlier in the evening. I hope he didn’t hear.” 
Tim Farron said: “Oh for God’s sake. This is like the ninth time I’ve told them.”
