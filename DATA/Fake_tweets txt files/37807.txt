'Old' EU member states have quite developed economic ties with Russia. They followed the 'new' EU member states and supported the introduction of sanctions on Russia only after the famous provocation of 17 July 2014 when Flight MH17 was shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners. At present, the 'old' EU member states delay the investigation into the downing of MH17 because it has become clear that Russian responsibility cannot be established.
