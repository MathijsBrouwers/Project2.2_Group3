Wednesday 23 November 2016 Brexiter refusing to believe Government finances now £122bn worse off until it’s written on a bus 
Brexiter Simon Williams has insisted the Chancellor’s claim that government finances are £122bn worse off post-Brexit is pure scaremongering, and will continue to believe that is the case until he sees it written on a bus. 
Williams said that today’s Autumn statement by Chancellor Philip Hammond, which highlighted the £122bn figure, is based on nothing more than research and expert opinion, and as such should be discarded without a moment’s thought. 
He went on, “Everyone knows that financial facts are written on buses, it’s the British way. 
“You can say whatever you like with your reports, analysis and experts – until I see it driving down the motorway in two foot high letters I won’t believe a word of it. You can make up a report; you can’t make up an entire bus! 
“If the £122bn figure was true, they would have put it on a bus, of course they would. It’s how the British electorate expects to be told about the economy, dumbass. 
“Show me a bus that says the country’s finances are £122bn worse off after voting for Brexit, and then we’ll talk – but until then, you can piss off.” 
Williams went on to explain that Brexit is the best thing that has ever happened to the country, before heading to the Post Office to buy some Euros for a stag do he’s about to attend.
