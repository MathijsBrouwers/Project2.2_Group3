Two new days have appeared in the history books - March 16 and 18, 2014. After the referendum on March 16, Sevastopol and the Crimean Republic were integrated in the Russian Federation two days later.

In Sevastopol people now re-learn the history from the point of view of Moscow. Crimea was Russian for a long time, before the Soviet empire changed the borders. At the beginning of the 90s, Kyiv started to force the entirely Russian-speaking population of the peninsula to learn Ukrainian and Ukrainian history.


"Everything is fine, everything is perfect, we have enough money," said a Crimean. Abandoned by Kyiv, the peninsula gains modernity. Pensions have been raised. The prices are higher than before, but so is the standard of living.
