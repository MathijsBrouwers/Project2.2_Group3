I found this you tube program interesting. I doubt if the people of the west, and those oligarchs under its sway would find this possible, much less support it ... but, it is worth cussing. Maybe even discussing ...

I very strange car bombing happened in Hurriyah neighborhood in Baghdad on October 30, 2016. The attack was mentioned by Western mainstream media, including Associated Press , New York Times , Daily Mail , and Al-Jazeera . Photos and video was shown of the aftermath. Allegedly 10 people died. 
But it seems no attack ever happened. A viral CCTV video on Arabic language shows what really happened. Two men drive away after setting up the bomb. Immediately after the explosion about 20 "crisis actor" wannabees rush to the scene and stage a White Helmets style rescue performance. 
I still do what happened. The Shia trying to make the Sunnis look bad? Or was the false even itself a hoax staged by ISIS to make the Shia look bad? Or the U.S. trying to incite sectarian violence? Posted by: Petri Krohn | Nov 4, 2016 3:36:41 PM | 2 Verify your Comment
