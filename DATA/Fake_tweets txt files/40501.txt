In addition to the SBU, there is this machine of informal terror (neo-Nazis) in Ukraine. They have a salary. They all have official documents. They have the opportunity to get weapons, training, field camps, etc. Without this machine of terror, power will simply be replaced by a popular uprising. These 15,000 people keep the entire population of Ukraine in fear.
