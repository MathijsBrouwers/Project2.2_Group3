NATO is simply an instrument of US foreign policy. No one has any doubts about it. This is what is being talked about in Europe.

The stationing of NATO weapons very close to the Russian borders is a "destructive activity" and poses a threat to Russia. Another problem is that NATO countries are hardly allowed to say anything against the Alliance stationing certain types of equipment on their territory. For example, parts of the missile defence system that would be deployed in Romania and soon also in Poland.
