In the Western world white male heterosexuals are branded as “exploiters” of everyone else: females, coloured people, homosexuals, new transgender species, Jews. White male heterosexuals cannot defend themselves against discrimination and are increasingly treated as criminals by courts. In the West, it is very difficult for a white male heterosexual to get a position in a university. In the UK and in European countries, university employment openings are restricted to women and coloured people.
