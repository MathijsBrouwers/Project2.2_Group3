NATO provokes Russia in the Black Sea region.

However, if we analyse the events of recent months, we can see that tensions in the Black Sea region are provoked not by Russia, but by NATO. (...) The Russian Federation Council (Upper House of Parliament) then said that NATO was flexing its' muscles and trying to demonstrate its presence in the western and southern border regions of Russia, while Georgia had become "part of the NATO mechanism for influencing Moscow".

The US has long had the idea of establishing a 'sanitary blockade' by states hostile to Russia - from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. (...) They will increase the pressure on Russia, and not just by their own efforts. Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Georgia should also participate. [...] The Black Sea region was nothing more than a new source of tension for the Americans, where they could provoke Russia. The recent incidents in the Kerch Strait are clear proof of this.
