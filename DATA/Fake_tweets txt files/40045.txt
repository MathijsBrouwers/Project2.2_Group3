The West incites hatred among the people of countries of ex-USSR. There is politically-motivated and artificially produced hatred, which is offered as a consumer product. It was offered to those, who were the beneficiaries of the project [of the Soviet Union].

They [Western nations] need this hatred because it is a tool to create conflict, albeit uncompromising. This is a mechanism, which either forces you or seduces you to refuse your identity and allows them to take everything that belongs to you.
