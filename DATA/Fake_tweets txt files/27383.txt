Wikileaks is the gift that keeps on giving… 

While not quite on the Bombshell level, we thought this email from Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta himself in March of last year deserved its very own thread… 

Text of the Podesta email: 
People tell me that Hillary is acting ‘like a retard’ since her head injury. Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I’m surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there’s anything he can give her. 
Also, I’ve noticed she’s had an ‘odor’ lately. It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I’m guessing it’s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes. Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don’t know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.

While John wonders whether the literal stench from Hillary is a mixture of urine and farts, we suspect that smell is properly identified as sulfur… This entry was posted in World News and tagged Anthony Weiner laptop , Hillary Clinton , Hillary smells like urine , Podesta Emails , Wikileaks bombshell , Wikileaks latest revelations , Wikileaks past 48 hours .
