As Twitchy told you , Hillary Clinton is so popular and beloved and popular that at her rally today, she turned the stage over to Michelle Obama. Now, you may wonder why Hillary would be giving Michelle the spotlight at her own rally, but as it turns out, there’s a very simple explanation: Michelle Obama is just so gosh-darn inspiring! “Seriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?” —Hillary

Seriously, you guys. I get liking Michelle Obama, even admiring her. But the notion she's off the charts inspiring is lost on me. https://t.co/TdGvODBQUu

Don’t worry — it’s lost on a lot of other people, too: @JonahNRO @bennyjohnson can we honestly ask why she's inspiring at all? What has she done that my wife couldn't have given FLOTUS assets? 
— Todd Lemmon (@toddlemmon) October 27, 2016 . @JonahNRO Michelle being the "most inspiring person ever" is like Clinton being the "most qualified candidate ever"

Did someone wipe Hillary’s memory clean? Like, with a cloth? @JonahNRO @bennyjohnson the bar has been set really low this year

OK, fair enough. But still. It’s not very hard to come up with a list of people more inspiring than Michelle Obama. @HillaryClinton yeah … how about the troops?
