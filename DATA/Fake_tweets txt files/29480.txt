Economists and eminent human rights lawyers alike have this week applauded the British stance on re-settling refugees from the Calais ‘jungle’. Professor Donald Rosarch from the Denver School for Human Rights Law mused ‘We admire the wisdom of western nations with aging populations angrily rejecting cohorts of fit young men and boys, none of whom are likely to be a burden to health services for some thirty or forty years. After their ordeal traveling thousands of miles on foot, sometimes after weeks at sea watching their friends die needlessly, these people somehow retain a remarkable humility and willingness to work. It is a dangerous situation.’ 
Ethel Brantingham from Kettering who eats kippers for breakfast in line with her political beliefs who named her terrier pup ‘Nigel’ reflected the views of the British electorate: ‘We simply cannot tolerate an influx of this sort of attitude, these people have learned nothing about entitlement and the values that made Britain great. Some of them even want to train as teachers or doctors. Imagine them in five years time, raising children and paying taxes in their droves, just as the majority of us were planning a neglected death in an underfunded state nursing home. Boris Johnson was right. Fuck everybody, its all about me.’ Share this story...
