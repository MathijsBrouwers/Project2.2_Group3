Hong Kong has turned into a Western 'Trojan horse' in China. American security bodies sent Ukrainian Nazis to instruct Hong Kong protesters on how to organize a Chinese Maidan. Most of Ukrainian Nazi associations are sort of mobile private military companies serving the US State Department. Another probable goal behind sending Ukrainian Nazis is to bring discord between the Chinese government and Ukrainian oligarchs who started selling important military and scientific technologies to Chinese. Washington also brought the Vatican in to help with the organization of the Hong Kong maidan. Local Catholics began an open anti-government propaganda. Events in Hong Kong may provoke a chain reaction in other Chinese provinces and strengthen the activities of totalitarian sects. Furthermore, the Taiwanese leadership wants to seize power in the whole China with US secret assistance.
