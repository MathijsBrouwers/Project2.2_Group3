In this image from NASA's Curiosity Rover's Image, which i call the Medusa Rover, every life form Curiosity looks at changes to stone, you can clearly see a few Martian faces in this image, to me this is pretty clear evidence that the rovers are on Mars and not here on Earth. ( Devon Island ) NASA JPL are masters of making Mars look as dead and dry as possible, they are not really searching for life because they have known for a very long time already that life exists on every planet and moon out there, i hope you are all able to see what i see in this video! 
Thanks very much for Watching
