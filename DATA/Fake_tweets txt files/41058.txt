During these three months, Georgia demonstrated to South Ossetia and the entire international community the whole set of clich√©s and tactical steps with which, in theory, the armed confrontation begins. More precisely, setting up a system of posts along the state border, pulling together power units, seizing strategic (high) positions and firing at a quadcopter of the General Prosecutor's Office of South Ossetia. In addition, shooting in the direction of the state border, attempting to infiltrate South Ossetian territory by armed groups and even using the EUMM as an element that can provoke Tskhinvali into inadequate behaviour.
