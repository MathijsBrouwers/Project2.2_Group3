Georgia signed the UN Global Compact for Migration, contrary to many other countries who want to protect their borders from migrants.

The UN Global Compact foresees that migrants' rights are fundamental. For that reason, any criticism of migrants will cause being named a racist or a xenophobe.

Signing the agreement means also that foreign countries can tell Georgia to let in migrants from Syria and Africa.
