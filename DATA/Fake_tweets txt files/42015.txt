Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in Sochi to sign a memorandum about Syria after intense negotiations. The provisions include the deployment of Russian-Syrian forces on the territories previously controlled by the US and Kurdish militias. This historical agreement will put an end to the US attempts to implement a ‘Great Kurdistan’, the creation of a Kurdish independent state on Turkey’s borders.
