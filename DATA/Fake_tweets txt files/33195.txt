The Riverside County District Attorney’s Office is seeking the death penalty against John Felix, charged with the murders of two Palm Springs police officers earlier this month, according to a press release from the DA’s office. Felix previously pleaded not guilty . 
Felix, 26, allegedly shot and killed officers Jose Vega, 63 and Lesley Zerebny, 27, on Saturday, Oct. 8. Felix, described as “self-admitted and known gang member” in the release, is believed to have ambushed the officers when they were responding to a family disturbance call. 
“This was a heinous crime involving the murders of two police officers who were gunned down simply because they were police officers,” Hestrin said in the release. “The victims in this case were responding to a call for service and died in the line of duty protecting our community.”
