After theÂ  collapse of the USSR, Western policy towards Russia has had a number of objectives including:

 	Slowing down Russian economic growth and the modernisation of its defense industry;
 	Creating instability around Russia and taking control of neighbouring countries' foreign policies;
 	Creating preconditions for managed chaos and Russia's collapse in order to get access to Russia's natural resources.
