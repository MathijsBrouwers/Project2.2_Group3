Ukraine acceded the EU in the sexual sense of this word. The law on sexual consent was adopted, not for the sake of Ukrainian people, but for the EU accession. It is a signal to the EU: "we do this the same way you do". It is also a part of transition to NATO standards, because EU accession must follow the accession to NATO. This law is a demonstration of the signal: "we are the same like you". This law is culturally alien to Ukraine - it is not Sweden. Ukraine has one of the lowest birth rates and this new regulation will make the situation worse.
