This is a tool of neo-conservatives [of the West]. The task of the creation of Saakashvili - a man without passport - is to create a zone of instability around Russia on the transit energy routes, both along the western border and in the Caucasus. Saakashvili's goal is Georgia. Saakashvili is needed to destabilise the Georgian internal political situation, and to disrupt this project of Russia's rapprochement with Iran [possible gas transit from Russia to Armenia and Iran]. This is the weapon of war against Russia.
