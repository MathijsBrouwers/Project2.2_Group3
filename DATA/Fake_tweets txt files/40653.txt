The Olympic movement is not only really sports. Originally in Antiquity, and then revived by Coubertin, as a sublimation of war. Because 'Citius, Altius, Fortius' are Olympic slogans: "Faster, Stronger and Higher". 'Fortius' is interpreted from Latin not only as "Stronger", but also as "More courageous". That is,Â  strength and courage was offered to measure. Not in combat, but in sports competitions.
