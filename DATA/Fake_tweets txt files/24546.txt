With all the threats from the UN putting troops in our country we need to remind them what happened to the Nazis and the camp guards after the war. Not only the UN soldiers but the countries who sent them will be held accountable for the actions of their troops. If they think the UN can protect they need to wake up. If they send a bunch of sexual predators over here we will hold them responsible. Also, we need to send as many as we can home in a box. No mercy no forgiveness stay out of our country.﻿
