We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] Lowry And McIlroy Off To Good Start At BLTC-NTPL-BDTN-STFL Tournament October 28, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , SPORT Share 0 Add Comment 
PLAY has begun at the BLTC-NTPL-BDTN-STFL golf tournament in Dubai, with Irish hopefuls Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry off to a flying start in the early going. 
With the tournament sponsored by four of the biggest financial institutions on the planet, both Lowry and McIlroy were able to shrug off any concerns about tropical diseases and viral infections, which hampered their availability for contests during the summer. 
Staying under par for the first 9 holes, the two athletes are competing for more money than most people could possibly earn in ten lifetimes and expect to end the tournament with at least a healthy sum from sponsorship, appearance fees and endorsements. 
“I’ll be honest with you, I’m not sure what all those initials stand for,” said Lowry, still Zika-free. 
“The ‘Bs’ are probably bank of something, ‘N’ might be national… I couldn’t tell you, truthfully. Now back up out of the way while I earn a hundred grand”. 
Meanwhile McIlroy fielded angry questions from gamers wanting to know why the Brazil level of this year’s edition of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour on PS4 was locked and unplayable.
