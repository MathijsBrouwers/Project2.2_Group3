0 comments Colin Kaepernick has started a kids camp inspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan and said he didn’t want the media to find out. 
Well I wonder why he would not want the media to find out he was taking such a far out approach with children? 
MAYBE his goal is to make little Black Panthers out of our youth? The NY DAILY NEWS reports: 
Please don’t say anything about it online,” Colin asked me a few days before the camp. “I’m not doing this for the press and I don’t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.” 
nspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th Anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. They were listed on the back of T-shirts given to each camper. 
“We’re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We’re here to give you tools to help you succeed,” he said. “We’re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we’re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.” 
Why couldn’t Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? Why so secretive? Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? 
Kaepernick could have taken another road. He has instead taken an anti-American, anti-Law Enforcement road. He has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of Patriotism and unity. 
Kaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels.
