Global power is in the hands of powerful elite groups - Zionists, US imperialists and militarists, eurocratic elites, deep states, petro-monarchies, and oligarchies of various countries. These elite groups cooperate among themselves to protect their power and privileges, to control the people, and to deceive the latter into believing that the people rule and that the system is democratic.

The Bilderberg groupÂ  was created in order to enable such elite groups to forge alliances and work out strategies to protect their own interests.
