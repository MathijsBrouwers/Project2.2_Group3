Warsaw does not carry out any type of policy towards its Eastern neighbours as all of the Polish foreign actions have turned into an instrument used to weaken the Russian positions in the post-Soviet region. For example, the Polish policy towards Ukraine has only one priority â€“ to keep this country in the orbit of the anti-Russian states. Poland's Eastern policy is formed by the actions dictated by the interests of the United States.
