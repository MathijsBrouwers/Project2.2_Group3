Bolivia and Venezuela are similar in their independent approach to following a socialist path to break away from the hegemonic interference and economic exploitation of the US and its allies.

And both countries have been subjected to a US-promoted hybrid war for regime change from a socialist government to a more neoliberal pro-US government.
