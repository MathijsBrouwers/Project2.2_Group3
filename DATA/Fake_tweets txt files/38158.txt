The spread of ideology claiming that Ukraine is not Russia and Ukrainians are not Russians caused the coup d'Ã©tat in Ukraine in 2014 and the following dramatic events. This same formula ("we are not Russians") is increasingly popular in Belarus, including among the Belarusian authorities. However, just as Russians and Ukrainians are the same people, Russians and Belarusians are the same people too. Pro-Western nationalistic opposition in Belarus has been working hard to undermine a common cultural and historical space between Belarus and Russia.
