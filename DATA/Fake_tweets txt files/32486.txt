A retired four-star general called out Donald Trump as unfit to be president because he has failed to support US troops. 
In a conference call with reporters, Gen. John Allen (Ret.) said: Trump’s remarks are not only uninformed…but it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I took great exception to this. However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. 
…. 
While [Trump] appears not to understand basic military activities, it’s not clear to me that he’s interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I think…would advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesn’t know. 
…. 
This kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day – it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief. 
Military experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. 
Thanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesn’t support the troops. 
Republicans have gone from “real America” to un-American in record time. 
If a presidential nominee doesn’t respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely won’t respect the needs of hard working Americans. 
With each word that comes out of his mouth, Trump continues to show America the real face of the Republican Party.
