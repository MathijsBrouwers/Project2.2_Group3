The strategy of order enforcement chosen by the prefect of Paris has been highly criticised. He wanted the Yellow Vests' demonstration to start at Place d'Italie, an area under construction which contains construction equipment, often thrown by the thugs and who, surprisingly, were there since the early morning.

Controversy is also growing over a video clearly showing "two people framing a third man, all dressed in black, who were behind the line of CRS [riot police] who let them pass whilst repeating: 'This is the BAC, it is the BAC [branch of the criminal police in France]'," as noted by Liberation's CheckNews. That led to accusations about police infiltrators within the thugs.

All this was wanted by the government only to destroy the anniversary of Yellow Vests. It's worse than a fracture. It serves the dictatorship that is being put in place.
