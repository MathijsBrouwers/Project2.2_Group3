The gas transmission system of Ukraine. It is an environmental disaster the world has not seen before. It is worse than Chernobyl because it emits extremely harmful substances into the environment. And these guys did not allow Russia to repair and clean it in due time.... This is a leaky pipeline, it is outdated and rusty, it is crumbling into dust. Even the most condescending environmental tender will say no to the [Ukrainian] gas transmission system.
