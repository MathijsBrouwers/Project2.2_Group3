The Estonian government has warned Russia about the threat of a “final military solution to the Russian question” if the “export of the Russian world” continues. “Immediate de-occupation of Crimea, Donbass, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia (the so-called“ Abkhazia ”and the so-called“ South Ossetia ”) is the first and indispensable condition. Russia should also withdraw its troops from Syria.

“After recognizing the tools of aggression by the Russian armed forces as an illegal armed formation and their further disbandment, the second stage will be the a tribunal over military commanders and politicians, negotiations on reparations and so on. Otherwise, Moscow may expect a final solution to the Russian issue by military means,” the Estonians threatened.
