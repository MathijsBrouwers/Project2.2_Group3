The thing is I’ve told them I’m prime minister, admits Farage 15-11-16 NIGEL Farage has admitted that he may accidentally have told Donald Trump he is Britain’s prime minister. The former UKIP leader confessed that he failed to correct an early misunderstanding which has now snowballed into a new transatlantic alliance. He said: “I went over, and Mr Trump congratulated me on running the UK after Brexit, and we were about to go on stage so I joked ‘Certainly a big responsibility, ha ha!’ “After a few fizzy Yank beers I found myself claiming that UKIP had been made the ruling party following an intervention by my friend, the Queen, and also that my wife was a former Miss Germany and Playboy model. “You’ve not met him, it’s like he makes you say these things. “Anyway he really seems to like me and it’s probably just easier for everyone if I just take over.” Farage added: “The ironic thing is, neither of us actually ever intended to lead a country because it’s a massive pain in the arse.”
