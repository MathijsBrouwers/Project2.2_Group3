NO THANKS! Michelle Malkin shreds FLOTUS and Hillary’s ‘it takes a village’ reboot Posted at 5:30 pm on October 27, 2016 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Michelle Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton today, and the First Lady ripped a page from Clinton’s “It Takes a Village”: FLOTUS says this election is about "who will shape our children and the country we lead for them…for the rest of their lives."

Michelle Malkin knows what that means, and responded accordingly: I'll shape my children, thank you very much. #HandsOffMyChildren https://t.co/BnWqBwbkiq

Thanks but no thanks, FLOTUS (and Hillary).
