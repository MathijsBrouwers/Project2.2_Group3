The West plans to destroy Russia and used social media manipulation for this purpose.

Russia is being pressured both from outside and from within. On the Internet, it's being constantly suggested that it is a shame to be Russian. This information campaign is supported by Google and Facebook, which intentionally promote the pro-Western narratives. Social networks are promoting illegal protests, boycotting of elections and street provocations in large cities. The West is striving to form an image of a government hostile to its people in the minds of Russians.

In addition to the Internet, the West is actively using video games and films for anti-Russian propaganda, trying to subjugate not only young people, but also older audiences.
