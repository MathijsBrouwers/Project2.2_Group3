October 27, 2016 Jews blamed for Holocaust in UK event slammed by Israeli embassy 
An event at the British Parliament’s House of Lords on Tuesday night set the stage for what the Israeli Embassy in London slammed as “racist tropes,” including accusations of Zionist power over the parliament and Jewish responsibility for the Holocaust. 
The event was hosted at the second chamber of the UK Parliament by former Liberal Democrat party MP Baroness Jennifer Tonge, who has previously been accused of harboring anti-Semitic stances.
