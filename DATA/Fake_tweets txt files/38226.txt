Ukraine is an anti-Russian project of the West. It doesn't matter who the president is - Zelenskyy or Poroshenko. The leadership of this country is forced to conduct an anti-Russian policy, since the state is fed by the West. Ukraine's mission is to create problems along the entire perimeter of Russia's borders. Even if Ukraine, theoretically, starts persecuting Jews, stops recognising the Holocaust, the West will close its eyes to this. It will continue as long as it plays the role dictated by the Western geopolitical centres. While the geopolitical role of Ukraine will satisfy the West, everything will be allowed to it.
