One of the most important institutions to preserve the Armenian people is our traditional Christian family. The ratification of the Istanbul Convention with many contradictory and dangerous provisions is a danger. It will disrupt the family-Christian values of the Armenian people. As a result, it is a threat to the Armenian Army's combat readiness and national spirit. The convention is contradicting the current Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, to the centuries-old Christian and moral values of the Armenian people.
