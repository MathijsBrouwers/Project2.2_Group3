Russia's Ministry of Defence thoroughly searched its archives and was able to identify the missile based on the fragments from the crash site. The Ministry determined the serial number and represented the entire life cycle of the missile.

The [BUK]-rocket, which was still manufactured in Soviet times, was brought to a military base in Ukraine in 1986. Since then, the rocket has never left the Ukrainian Soviet Republic nor, after the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the BUK missile was only transported within Ukrainian territory.
