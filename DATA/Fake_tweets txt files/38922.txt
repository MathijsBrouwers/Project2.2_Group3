The EU is attempting to gain control over fuel resources in the Mediterranean via the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). An informal meeting between the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) Mustafa Akinci and South Cyprus leader Nikos Anastasiadis will take place to discuss the accession of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus by the EU. According to this plan, Turkey would cease to act as guarantor of the TRNC and would remove its troops from there. In consequence, the Cyprus Federation would be established and the Turkish part of Cyprus would also be accepted to the EU.

The aim of this plan is to completely eliminate Northern Cyprus, to get rid of Turkey from there and to enable the delivery of all gas and oil supplies around Cyprus to Europe via Greece.
