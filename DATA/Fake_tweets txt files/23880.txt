Colorado Radio Station’s Paul Martin Interviews Dave Hodges on Election Fraud and Standing Rock 
I was recently interviewed on “The Lion” radio station in Johnstown, Colorado by guest host, Paul Martin. 
Paul and I discussed how rampant the election fraud has become and the elite may still pull the plug on the election if Trump continues to surge. We also discussed the latest in Wikileaks and what it means to the election and the American people.
