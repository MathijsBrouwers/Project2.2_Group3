A joint Belarusian-Russia state should have common interests, values, ideals and dreams of the all-Russian world. Then it would effectively withstand external attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations, to discredit the common history and to implement neo-colonial policies. The establishment of a Belarusian-Russian Union with common values and traditions would secure a free and independent future and would prevent Belarus and Russia from becoming a devastated, humiliated colony of American or European projects.
