Ukraine's responsibility for the downing of the MH17 Boeing five years ago over eastern Ukraine can not be ruled out.

The Boeing 777 of Malaysia Airlines crashed on 17 July 2014 in the fiercely contested East Ukrainian Donetsk region. The Ukrainian army and armed government opponents fought fierce battles in the region.Â  The government in Kyiv and the people's militias of the unrecognised Republic of Donetsk accused each other of shooting down the jet.

Even before the investigation began, many Kyiv and Western politicians had blamed the East Ukrainian people's militias for the alleged shooting and accused Russia of an involvement in the shooting down.
