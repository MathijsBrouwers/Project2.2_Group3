There have been many reports in Maryland and Texas, among other places, of people going in to vote (“early voting”) and voting for Trump to learn that their vote was flipped to Clinton. Quite a few Trump voters in Maryland have checked their votes and discovered this, with the election officials explaining that it was an electronic/mechanical error.
