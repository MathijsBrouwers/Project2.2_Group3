US political analysts: complete failure of the US military industry.

This hysteria is related to the fact that the United States sincerely believed that in the military sphere it is ahead of Russia. And for those, who are at the helm of America, it was unthinkable that Russia and China could catch up with us and become a real threat. This happened already before, when the US wanted to destroy the USSR and was wasting, spending, spending money on it. But now it's quite different: trillions of dollars that the Americans have been pouring into the defense industry, were let down during the last 20 years. It's just a complete failure.
