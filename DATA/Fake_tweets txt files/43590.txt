Russian meteorologists forecast abnormally warm weather in the northern part of European and Asian parts of Russia from October to March, whereas an abnormal cold will come to the Russian south. Does it mean that 16-year old Greta Thunberg is right about anything? Of course not. The only thing we can reliably speak of is sufficiently radical climate change, but there is nothing unusual about it. Real science knowns absolutely no proofs of human impacts on climate change. If only the Nobel Prize for the former US Vice President Al Gore is not considered as a proof, but this is rather a non-scientific mishap.
