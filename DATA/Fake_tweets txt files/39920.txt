The assumption that the toxic agent had been transported in an ordinary bottle of perfume looked weird, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations said at the Security Council. 


"According to reports by OPCW experts, including those related to Amesbury incident, this substance is very toxic and dangerous, and can be carried only in special reinforced containers. Otherwise, the transporter will be the first to be harmed," he added.
