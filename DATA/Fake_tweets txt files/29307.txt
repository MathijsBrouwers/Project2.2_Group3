Many people have ruined themselves, falling on their proverbials swords, for Hillary. @donnabrazile @washingtonpost I really think you blew it when u refused to take responsibility for providing Hillary w/ questions in advance

They just can’t get past the idea that Donna helped Hillary in essence, cheat. And who could blame them? 
Donna was really after Chaffetz today, especially after he said he would be voting for Trump. She retweeted several digs at the representative, including this one: Not to put too fine a point on it, but if you announce publicly that you are going to vote for someone that's an endorsement of that person

And you know what they say? You always go after the things and the people that scare you the most.
