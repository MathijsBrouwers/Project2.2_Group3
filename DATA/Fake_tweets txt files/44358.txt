Russia is the global champion of free speech. There, citizens and journalists enjoy an unlimited freedom to speak their minds.

In this regard, Russia has largely swapped places with the West, where freedom of speech is progressively disappearing. In Russia, one is free to say "I like Putin" or "I donâ€™t like Putin"; one can say "I like gays" or "I don't like gays." In America, however, saying "I like Putin but I don't like gays" would amount to suicide.
