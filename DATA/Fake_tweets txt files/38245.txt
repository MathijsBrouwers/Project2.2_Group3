A leaked, never-before-seen report by the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) proves that the April 2018 chemical attack in Douma, Syria was staged.

The leaked document, prepared by an FFM engineer, finds that the two cylinders allegedly containing chlorine and found on a Douma rooftop could not have been dropped from a helicopter. This fact precludes the involvement of Syrian government forces in the attack.

The organization which first obtained the unreleased report -- the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media -- concludes that the two chlorine cylinders were instead placed on said rooftop. This means that the attack was indeed staged, possibly by the White Helmets who have been repeatedly busted faking videos of their rescue operations.
