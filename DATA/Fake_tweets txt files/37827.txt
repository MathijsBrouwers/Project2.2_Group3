Sending two Moldovan military contingents, on June 28 2019, to participate in exercises in the US and Ukraine is aimed at preparing soldiers and officers for a possible attack on Transnistria, which means preparing for an anti-Russian confrontation. The anti-Russian character of these manoeuvers is concealed neither by the organisers of the exercises nor the participants.
