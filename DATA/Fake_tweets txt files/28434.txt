October 31, 2016 Powerful earthquake hits central Italy for the third time 
A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 has rocked the same area of central and southern Italy hit by quake in August and a pair of aftershocks last week, sending already quake-damaged buildings crumbling after a week of temblors that have left thousands homeless. 
There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. Residents already rattled by a constant trembling of the earth rushed into piazzas and streets after being roused from bed by Sundayâ€™s 7:40am quake. Many people still had been sleeping in cars or evacuated to shelters or hotels in other areas after a pair of strong jolts last Wednesday. 

Television images showed nuns rushing out of their church and into the main piazza in Norcia as the clock tower appeared about to crumble.
