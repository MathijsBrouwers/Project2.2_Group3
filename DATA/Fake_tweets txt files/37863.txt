The task of manipulating the media has always been a top priority for the CIA. A program for Internship for journalists from Central Asia has been launched. Those hand-picked by Uncle Sam will now receive training in the United States next month. The US State Department has already sent appropriate invitations to various media personalities from across the Central Asia, while all of the US embassies across the region are tasked with making sure that everything would go smooth. Unsurprisingly, the funding of this “internship” program is going to be provided by the US Central Command.

Uncle Sam will try to learn just how loyal those media personalities will be to the United States before instructing them further. That is the true price that the world is paying for the American-style democracy, that is the death of truthful journalism.
