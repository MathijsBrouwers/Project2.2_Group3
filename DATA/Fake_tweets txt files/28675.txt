Looking For Proof Of Evolution? You Can Find It On Your Own Body   March 20, 2016 Subscribe 
There are some who like to say that evolution is merely a theory and that man was created by God. The debate between the opposing ideas of evolution versus creationism have been going on for decades, and will probably never end, despite the fact that science conclusively proves evolution to be real and verifiable. 
Perhaps nothing proves evolution more than the existence of vestigial structures. Vestigial structures are what can best be called evolutionâ€™s leftovers. They are body parts that have outlived the context through which they came to be. 
As this video from Vox proves, we carry these structures with us each and every day, and they should remind us of just how incredible and adaptable the human form truly is.
