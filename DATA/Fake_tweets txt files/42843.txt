The White Helmets have helped to justify in the media Western interference in the Syrian crisis, but they have also repeatedly contributed to ridicule those media. These media rescuers with close ties to al-Qaeda, have indeed received a financial boost of 4.5 million dollars (4 million euros) from US.

The White Helmets were repeatedly caught spreading misinformation.

In April 2018, images of an alleged chemical attack on a hospital flood social networks. Washington, London, followed by Paris, lead strikes against three sites of "the clandestine chemical arsenal of the Syrian regime" [...]. Three sites that were, in fact, under regular surveillance by the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), which found nothing to complain about.

While jihadists are globally defeated in Syria, why are the United States continuing their financial support to the White Helmets?
