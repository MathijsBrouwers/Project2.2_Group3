16-Years-Old smdh. He’s Only a Child.

As I’ve said for a long time now, it appears that Neo-Nazi satirists have infiltrated the Jewish media and are using their positions to mock the insane depths to which Jew lies have sunk. 
Seriously, if I was running the Guardian, I would absolutely run this on the cover: a picture of a 40-something Negro crying, with the headline that he’s a child and a caption saying he’s 16-years-old. 
If I was going to push it further than this, I would print the lyrics to Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven” in the sidebar. And I am predicting now that they are going to use this song in a video about Calais migrants having no where to go now that the French Nazis burned their camp. Or rather, now that they burned their own camp because the French Nazis told them they had to leave and it is “their tradition” ( IRL quote from French official ) to burn their homes when they leave them. 
Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong‘Cause I know I don’t belong Here in heaven 
Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven? 
I’ll find my way Through night and day‘Cause I know I just can’t stay Here in heaven 
Time can bring you down Time can bend your knees Time can break your heart Have you begging please, begging please 
Beyond the door There’s peace I’m sure And I know there’ll be no more Tears in heaven 
Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong‘Cause I know I don’t belong Here in heaven
