Obi-Wan Kenobi has reported a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. 
The wise old man felt the disturbance whilst chatting to his young apprentice and felt a sudden need for a sit down, muttering ‘something terrible has happened’. 
Jedi Master Kenobi, who fought with Bail Organa in the Clone Wars, is currently uncertain of the cause of the disturbance but suggests some sort of planet-busting doomsday event may have occurred. 
“I’m hoping it’s just a giant space-laser obliterating an entire civilisation; that’s probably the least-worst possible cause,” he confirmed. 
“Failing that, it’s likely something dark side-y. Some kinda of colossal use of the mind trick, maybe? 
“Something something dark side something,” he added.
