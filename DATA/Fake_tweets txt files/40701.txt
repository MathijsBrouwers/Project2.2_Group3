The Czech government has signed the PESCO agreement, which (although it does not say openly) means creating an Euro-Army. The aim is to push NATO out, because in the Alliance everything must be decided by absolute consensus, but in the EU, Brussels decides. Once the Czech army will be subjected to the EU, there will be no national control but all orders will come from Brussels.
