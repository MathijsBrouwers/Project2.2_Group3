An important feature of all-Russian history is respect for moral values, which denies evil and violence and does not allow other people to be insulted.

The Western history is full of these - crusades, inquisition, Jesuitism, colonialism and present-time intervention against unwanted countries are some examples. It is the high morals of all-Russian and Soviet history which will help to overcome an unworthy and anti-historical policy aimed to disengage the Belarusian and Russian peoples and to disintegrate the post-Soviet space under the pretext of Euro integration and protection of sovereignty.
