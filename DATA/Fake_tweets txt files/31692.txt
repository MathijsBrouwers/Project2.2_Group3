The news follows Mourinho’s criticism of Chris Smalling for not playing with a broken toe and Luke Shaw for having a broken leg and not being ‘brave.’ 
“My players are all total bastards,” said the grumpy Portuguese, either as some magnificent psychological game that no one but he can understand, or as another stage in what increasingly looks like a total psychotic breakdown. 
“I despise them for not making the goals I want, but I am Mourinho. I understand players. How to make them play better for me. 
“I will punch them in the face. All of them. I will continue to punch them all in the face until they score all the goals I want them to. 
“I am no longer the Special One, I am the Punchy One.”
