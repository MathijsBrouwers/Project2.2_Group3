There is still no evidence of Russian involvement in the MH17 disaster; just rumours.

Russia's Foreign Ministry has rejected the Joint Investigation Team's allegations that Russians were involved in the Malaysian Airlines Boeing MH17 crash in 2014. As in previous Joint Investigation Team press conferences, not a single piece of concrete evidence has been presented to substantiate such unlawful statements. The Joint Investigation Team is obviously confining itself to arguments that are not entirely reasonable.

No information was available on the involvement of the Russian citizens mentioned in the 2014 Donbas air crash.
