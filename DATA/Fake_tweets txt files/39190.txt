Around the 26th of January the al-Nusra terrorist organisation, supported by the White Helmets, transported several containers of chlorine gas to the southern part of the Idlib province in Syria. The containers, placed in the Khan-Sheikhun depots, are meant to be used against civilians, either in this area or in another location.
