The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (SMM) has rejected the allegations made by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations about the alleged presence of Russian soldiers in the disputed Ukrainian region of Donbass. There had been information that someone had seen people in military uniforms who allegedly claimed to come from Russia and other countries and to be mercenaries. Someone also saw a transport device with Russian flags. However, it is not known which origin it is.
