[11/3/16] Thomson Reuters Corp. said on Tuesday it will lay off about 2,000 workers, and sustain a charge of up to $250 million in the current quarter, connected to a “transformation” of its business. 
The company, which provides news and information services to professionals, also reported flat revenue and lower profit for the quarter. 
Thomson Reuters employs some 48,000 people world-wide. The restructuring would mainly impact the Financial & Risk business and the Enterprise, Technology & Operations Group, according to a news report from Reuters, which also noted that none of the cuts would be in the company’s newsroom. 
Thomson Reuters said it expects to record a charge in the current quarter between $200 million and $250 million linked to the restructuring program.
