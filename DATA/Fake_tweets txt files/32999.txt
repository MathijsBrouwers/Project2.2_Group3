Next Swipe left/right UK manages to go half an hour without a racist outburst on public transport The UK has set an incredible new national record after going almost thirty minutes without any noticeable racist outbursts on public transport. 
The half hour relatively free of racist abuse happened between 2.34 and 3.03pm yesterday afternoon, at which point a ranting prick on a bus in Kidderminster told another passenger to fuck of back to his own country and that he looked like a paedophile. 
“This is a truly momentous and special day for the UK,” said Home Secretary Amber Rudd. 
“If we can manage almost half an hour relatively free of violent racist abuse in public, then with some hard work and determination I see no reason why we can’t expand that to fourty or perhaps even fourty five minutes in ten year’s time.” 
“People might even be able to make an entire journey without being screamed at by a deluded bigot. That would be an incredible legacy for the people of Britain to pass down to their children.”
