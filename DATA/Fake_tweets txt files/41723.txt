It can’t be known whether the US operation to kill Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi really took place. The Syrian radars didn’t register the US aircraft that allegedly participated in the operation. It may be a trick, and Al Baghdadi will reappear with a different name, as a different individual or the whole Islamic State will reproduce itself when it is convenient for its backers, under a different name but with the same ideology and purpose.
