There is no doubt that Ukraine was one of the geopolitical projects. Under the temporary government of Kerensky, it pursued one goal, during the Soviet Union the goal was another, and then a different goal in the post-Soviet era. Finally, Ukraine became a headache. 

The project 'Ukraine' is now over. A viable and complete Ukraine is no longer needed. Neither the geopolitical poles, nor the regional and neighbouring states, nor the people who are in conflict need this country. Now Ukraine is like a deadly wounded animal, and every interested party wants to get a bigger piece.
