Report on the phone call held between President’s Putin and Obama says that was discussed that the much feared time for the “Apocalypse Equation” may be now, not later.

The “Apocalypse Equation” refers to report authored by one of the most secretive women in US intelligence circles named Audrey Tomason who is Obama’s Director for Counterterrorism suggesting that it would be more humane for our world to undergo a “planned and controlled genocide” rather than to see it descend into the abyss of chaos it is now entering.


The Apocalypse Equation, (technically called a "stochastic equation," because it describes the relationship of probability to time) shows what nuclear weapons ultimately mean for "civilization." If each of a large number of nuclear missiles existing today has even a small probability of being launched, over time the probability of a launch (APocalypse) approaches certainty. The more missiles, the shorter the time before a launch. Unless nuclear weapons are deactivated, and nonviolent means developed to take the place of military violence for achieving justice and peace, civilization is doomed .
