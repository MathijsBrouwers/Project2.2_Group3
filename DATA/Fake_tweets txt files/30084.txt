Militants in Syria have filmed their “meeting” with Russian air forces in Aleppo.  
In the footage released, the bandits are heating themselves by a small fire before one of them says that a Russian fighter is approaching. The militant says “Allahu akbar, the Russians are here!” The rest of the group begin to look up in the sky as the roar of Russian military aircraft is suddenly heard above them.  

The terrorists then run in terror and disperse in different directions, falling onto the ground and dropping their dishes.
