Good for them : 
âPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â A federal jury has found Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants not guilty on all charges for taking over a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon earlier this year. 
Standoff leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Several also were charged with possessing a firearm in a federal facility. âŚ 
On emotional grounds, Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an out-of-control federal government that has crippled the rural West. 
Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. An FBI agent testified that 16,636 live rounds and nearly 1,700 spent casings were found. 
Bundy testified in his defense, spending three days amplifying his belief that government overreach is destroying Western communities that rely on the land âŚâ 
Hereâs a toast to their acquittal! The acquittal of Bundy brothers in #oregonstandoff is the epitome of white privilege. Two different justice systems! https://t.co/F3GmNgYLrW
