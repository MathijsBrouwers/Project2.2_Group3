The Pope predicted a Europe full of immigrants: "I see the the 3rd millennium's Church suffering a deadly wound which, compared to this millennium (Nazism and communism), will be deeper and more painful". In his prophecy (mentioned by an Italian priest), Pope John Paul II asked "the representatives of the 3rd millennium's Church to stop the invasion" of migrants.
