The US AEGIS system in Romania is ready to attack Russia with cruise missiles.

According to information from military analysts, the USA is continuing to expand its missile base in Romania. The Mk 41 vertical launch facility there is designed to attack land targets with Tomahawk cruise missiles.

Modernising the Deveselu site poses a real threat to Russia that should not go unanswered, and Moscow has a wide range of possible countermeasures at its disposal.

The USA is probably planning to station the BGM-109 Tomahawk land-based US cruise missiles there, which had previously been banned by the INF Treaty.
