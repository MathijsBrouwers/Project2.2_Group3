This year's Munich Security conference brings to mind the Munich agreement of 1938, which allowed Nazi Germany to begin its large-scale aggression in Europe. As in 1938, when the West expected to facilitate Nazi Germany's aggression against the USSR, many guests of today's Munich Conference have aggressive intentions towards Russia. They are preparing the ground by spreading speculation about Russian aggression and interference in Western elections. The Munich Security Conference has little impact on security in Europe. The meeting between Putin and Lukashenko and the development of the Union State is of greater importance for peace in Europe and globally, than discussions at the Munich Conference.
