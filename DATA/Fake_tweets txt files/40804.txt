Al-Baghdadi was [if he is really dead] an American product. IS was established after the illegal invasion of Iraq, the collapse of the Iraqi state, and the release of extremists who were detained by the US. Therefore, the Americans have destroyed the person they have produced, if it is true that they killed him.
