The Russian president’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, has replied to NATO General Secretary Jens Stolstenberg’s statement on strengthening forces due to Russia’s “activeness.” The Kremlin’s spokesperson categorized such as evidence of the “aggressive nature of NATO” and recalled that the blocs which NATO members opposed have long since disappeared, but the alliance’s behavior has not changed. 
“Stoltenberg’s statement once again testifies to the aggressive nature of this organization. Despite the fact that the counter-bloc to NATO no longer exists, still this nature is impossible to eradicate for ideological and political reasons,” Peskov is quoted as saying by TASS.  
The approach of NATO military infrastructure up to the borders of the Russian Federation is a fact indicative of the aggressive intentions of the alliance. Meanwhile, “in terms of ensuring its national security, Russia is acting within its borders and these actions do not threaten anyone,” Putin’s press secretary added. 

Jens Stoltenberg earlier stated that NATO is planning to transfer a portion of its troops to strengthen its operations in response to Russia’s activities.
