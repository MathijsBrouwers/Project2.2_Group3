Two liberals on a crusade submit petition for Oregon to secede from the Union New petition hopes to make Oregon a 'safe space' as bigoted liberals plan State's succession By Shepard Ambellas - November 11, 2016 PORTLAND ( INTELLIHUB ) — Two liberals by the names of Jennifer Rollins and Christian Trejbal, likely offended by the powerhouse personality of the new President-Elect, have filed a petition for the State of Oregon to secede from the Union. 
The petition for a 2018 ballot initiative will require only 1,000 signatures to move forward as the two wish to make the state a liberal safe-space, where robust personalities with vigor can’t encroach on their feelings. 
Trejbal told the Oregonian Thursday, “Oregonian values are no longer the values held by the rest of the United States.” 
“Those values? “Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.” 
So essentially you have two bigoted liberals who likely crave open borders, more tax, more security arising from false flag attacks like 9/11 and transgender bathrooms. 
Is this what they call “happiness?” 
Ladies and gentlemen, if this is the mindset of Oregonians — then all I have to say is good riddance. 
However, I suspect that it is not the mindset of most Oregonians and that these two crazed loons have their own agenda in which it is okay for them to express their ideology but they do not want others, like Trump, to express his. 
The not so dynamic duo plans to get the 1,000 signatures needed by the end of Thursday.
