Russophobia in Georgia is artificial. Georgian people don't have a negative attitude towards Russians and Russia. But Georgia doesn’t have its voice. The current government of Georgia is not independent, it broadcasts a foreign voice. The “patrons” from the outside are doing everything to prevent Georgia from getting closer to Russia. They work very actively with civil society, and this will not end tomorrow.
