AUDIO TAPE OF HILLARY LEAKED ABOUT RIGGING ELECTION 20.2K shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / According to the Observer , “On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.” Her conversation was secretly recorded. 
The audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. 
Chomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that “anyone could support the idea – offered by a national political leader, no less – that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” The Observer is owned by Donald Trump’s son in law. 
Here is the audio recording:
