The economic problems in Europe are gradually more noticeable. 20 years after the adoption of euro not all the European counties benefited from the common currency and Italy has been affected in the most negative way. Before the adoption of euro Italy did not have 5 million people below the poverty line, companies were not shut down and the young people did not have to move abroad. The responsibility for that lies on the European Union.
