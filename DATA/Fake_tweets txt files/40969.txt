West does not want a strong and independent Russia. It has planned the collapse of Russia by splitting the society and dividing its regions by 2030, reveals a RIA FAN study. This will be similar to how the USSR was destroyed.

West is destabilizing Russia from the inside, artificially creating the reputation of an "aggressor". It tries to convince Russians that their authorities are an enemy and uses the so-called opposition to promote pro-Western narratives in exchange for money.

The main goal of the West is the complete federalization of Russia with a final step of annexing the regions to other countries. North Ossetia will reunite with South and form a new state - Alania. China will annex some Russian eastern territories. Kamchatka, Chukotka will be occupied by the US, and Magadan Region, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to Japan. Kaliningrad region and Crimea will fall under the control of the European Union. The descendants of the Nazis who fled in 1945 will return to Kaliningrad, which will be renamed Koenigsberg. The Murmansk region will go to Norway, and Karelia will be given to Finland.
