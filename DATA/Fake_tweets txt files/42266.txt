The US needs the war in Syria, while Russia wants peace. The official doctrine of the US is to cause “directed chaos”. The US declared war on the whole of humanity. According to the US National Security Strategy, there is no alternative to the leading role of the US and there will be no multipolar world. The US will defend its interests militarily anywhere on Earth and beyond, it will not take into consideration international norms, and will unilaterally use military power in those territories where people will question this fact.
