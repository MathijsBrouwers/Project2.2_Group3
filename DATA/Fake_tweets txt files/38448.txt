Washington castrated the European Union at its birth by imposing a clause to be inserted in the Treaty of Maastricht – the "suzerainty" of NATO. The EU has a vassal status in relation to the United States. We should remember the total support offered by the European Union to all of the Pentagon’s adventures, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. In all these cases, without exception, the EU marched along its suzerain, NATO.

The European Union, which was imagined at a time when the world was divided into two irreconcilable blocs, is today completely unadapted. If they want to avoid being dragged by the United States into conflicts which are not their own, its members will have to free themselves from the European treaties and the integrated command of NATO.
