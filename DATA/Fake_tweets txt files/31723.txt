Most sane people are horrified at the idea of a Donald Trump presidency. However, there’s a substantial portion of the electorate that seems not to see just how absolutely dangerous the guy is as just a presidential candidate, much less how dangerous he would be as president. However, it seems that some of Trump’s supporters DO recognize that he’s a total nutcase, but plan to vote for him anyway. One woman’s reason is truly out of this world. A lady named Crystal said of her choice to vote for Trump: 
“Oh I think he’s crazy, and he may get us killed, but at least he’s going to be truthful with us.” Ultimate Trump Voter Quote, from Crystal: "Oh I think he's crazy, and he may get us killed, but at least he's going to be truthful with us." pic.twitter.com/Qz4u7OIzB0

Of course, Crystal’s reason for her choice prompted much ridicule on Twitter. Here are just a few of the more fun tweets laughing at the absurdity of this logic: @MikeLewisTO @ddale8 "I'm nuking Germany because that dog Angela Merkel said my hands were tiny. Believe me. Get affairs in order now."
