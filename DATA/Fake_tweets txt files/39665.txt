The program of Megyn Kelly, our favorite American TV anchor, is being taken off the air. She was fired on a completely contrived pretext -- for something she did not say about the color of Halloween masks. Something like ‘if a black person can wear a white mask, why then can’t a white person wear a black mask?’ Or, maybe the opposite. However, it doesn’t matter. I am sure that the true reason is our love for her.
