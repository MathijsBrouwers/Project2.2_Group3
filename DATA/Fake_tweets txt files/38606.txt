Russia does not occupy Ukrainian territory. The words 'occupation' or 'annexation' are completely inapplicable to the Crimea - neither de facto nor de jure.

The self-proclaimed people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk were repelled by Kyiv and everything that happens in the region is a consequence of the policies of Ukraine's current leadership.
