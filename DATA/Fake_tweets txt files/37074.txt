There are some Western countries who actively support the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty in information space, Poland as the US lapdog, and some Baltic states. At the same time, many American analysts began discussing the hypothetical nuclear war between Russia, on the one hand, and the US and NATO, on the other. Nuclear war is presented by them as imminent. They calculate how many bombs will be needed for Moscow, Washington, New York, or St. Petersburg. The world is educated about the inevitability of nuclear war. Hence we see media covering the preparation of the US and NATO for a nuclear war. This is very worrisome given the Ukrainian situation, heated by the US.
