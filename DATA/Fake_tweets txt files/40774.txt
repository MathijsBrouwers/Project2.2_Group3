All our people, unfortunately, both Russian and non-Russian, who live in the Baltics, are permanently being injected with the idea of a Russian threat. The aim is to build up military presence there. In fact it is an occupation of the Eastern Europe by NATO, where they [the West] always implement their economic interests. A very important goal is to destabilize Russia. [...]Local war, unfortunately, is inevitable [in Europe]. The victims of this war will be, first of all, the Baltic population and the population of the Eastern Europe.
