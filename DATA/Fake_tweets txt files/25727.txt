Scores of celebrities openly claimed that they would leave America and head for greener pastures elsewhere should Trump be elected. Last night, they weren’t alone. As results were tallied across the United States and a Donald Trump Presidency became imminent, Canadian officials report that their immigration website received so much traffic it took down the system.

Some users in the United States, Canada and Asia saw an internal server error message when trying to access the www.cic.gc.ca/ website.
