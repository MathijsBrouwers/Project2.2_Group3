If so, then Hillary and Obama will end up being among the most unpopular Presidents in US history and and Hillary will be EASILY replaced by Elizabeth Warren. Hillary might even be impeached for grossly violating her Presidential Oath of Office! Frankly, I don't think Hillary is so dumb as to do that. If Obama pushed the TPP through Congress during the "lame duck" session of Congress, his "legacy" will be seriously tarnished for generations to come! He and Hillary will be PERSONALLY BLAMED for every multi-million or multi-billion dollar ISDS lawsuit against any level of our government (i.e. US taxpayers) forever after!
