The intelligence services of France and Belgium are preparing a false-flag chemical attack in Syria's Idlib province, in coordination with local terrorist cells and the pseudo-humanitarian White Helmets group. Once filmed, the footage will be doctored to "prove" Moscow's involvement in the attack.

Russia has repeatedly warned of Western false-flag operations in Syria, such as the planned September 2018 chemical attack designed to justify coalition airstrikes on Syrian government troops. The operation was exposed by Moscow and aborted.
