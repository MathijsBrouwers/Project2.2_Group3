Beyond the economic support provided by USAID, the political forces behind the agency aim to organize a coup in Moldova in favour of the pro-Western parties.Â We will see a gradual removal of the pro-Eastern political leaders or, at least, a diminution of their influence. USAID is primarily aimed at destroying diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation in order to strengthen the US position in Moldova and South-Eastern Europe.

USAID will try to decentralize Moldova and after that Moldova will be annexed by Romania.
