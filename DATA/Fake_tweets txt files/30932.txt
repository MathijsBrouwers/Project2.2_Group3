Sberbank is going to introduce Samsung pay technology in the near future, Sberbank CEO German Gref told reporters on Oct. 28. 
"We are currently working on Samsung pay. I think we will introduce it in the near future," he said. 
Gref also noted that the bank is working to make Samsung pay and Apple pay available for cards of all payment systems, including Visa and Mir. 
In early October, Sberbank and MasterCard launched Apple Pay system on the Russian market. 
According to Sberbank, Apple Pay can be easily set up in the Sberbank Online mobile application, which is familiar to all Sberbank cardholders. Users can enjoy contactless payment service while continuing to receive all the benefits from using their credit and debit cards. 
Apple Pay works with iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and later, and Apple Watch.
