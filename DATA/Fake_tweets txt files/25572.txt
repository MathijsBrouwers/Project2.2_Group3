Donald Trump has been rushed off the stage in Reno by Secret Service agents. It is unclear exactly what happened but unconfirmed reports indicate that an anti-Trump protester in the crowd flashed a gun.
Crowd response and Secret service activity immediately following Trump’s evacuation from the stage shows at least one individual being restrained just feet from where Trump was speaking.
Has the Secret Service thwarted an assassination ?
