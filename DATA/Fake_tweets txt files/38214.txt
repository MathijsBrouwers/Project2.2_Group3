Mueller report presents no traces of Russian interference in US elections.

Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller had spent almost two years investigating whether Trump's 2016 election campaign team had colluded with Russia and whether this had led to obstructions of justice.Â  At the end of March, he presented his final report, according to which no conclusive evidence of a crime could be found.
