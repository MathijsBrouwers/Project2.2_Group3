The result of Western reforms is criminal groups occupying the prosecutor's office. The whole system of Moldovan justice has turned out to be corrupt. And according to the Minister of Justice, “the situation in the prosecutor’s office is very bad; there are, most likely, criminal groups that were covering numerous crimes”.

You see, criminal groups appeared in the Moldovan prosecutor’s office, and it is a hotbed of crime. And all this was the result of previous “reforms” of the justice system. But who led the process and financed it? Washington and Brussels. And inspired, and encouraged.

Grants, cheap loans, financial assistance - this is a West's long-standing strategy in subordinating other states and establishing control over them.
