It looks like Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton picked the right running mate; Sen. Tim Kaine is just as big of a flake as she is. Not only that, he draws similar small, anemic crowds. Birds of a feather… 
Kaine had a campaign event scheduled for 6 p.m. on Friday in Sarasota, Florida’s Municipal Auditorium, but cancelled without a reason — although the embarrassment he suffered with a pathetically small turnout at a rally earlier in the week may have something to do with it. 
The event is listed on Clinton’s campaign website with the following message: “This event has been cancelled. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience.” 
Breitbart reported : 
The cancellation comes at a time when both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are making aggressive pushes in the Sunshine State to win the state’s 29 electoral votes. Trump earlier this week wrapped a five-stop swing through Florida and Clinton on Wednesday wrapped up a three-stop trip. 
Kaine’s scheduled visit to Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University in the northern part of the state on Friday still appears to be on. 
Earlier this week Kaine held a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida where only around 30 people showed up — including “journalists and operatives,” according to The Gateway Pundit .
