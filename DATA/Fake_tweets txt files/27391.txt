By late Thursday and early Friday morning police dressed in riot gear with armored vehicles were forced to intervene with activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline pipeline would run within a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. 
By midnight authorities arrested 141 protesters during a standoff that lasted more than six-hours on property that sits in the pipeline’s path. 
Protesters blockaded roads and bridges by setting fire to bales of hay and construction equipment. Police also said some protesters threw rocks and fire bombs, and one women even fired three shots from at police, but nobody was hit. 
More than 200 police officers were called in to stop the protests and were forced to use pepper spray and bean bag guns. Humvees, two helicopters and an airplane were also called in to assist law enforcement. 
Authorities said the protesters left the officers with no choice but to intervene. 
“We’re trying to avoid confrontation. But they drew the line in the sand today,” Cass County Sheriff Paul D. Laney told reporters Thursday. 
The protesters were a group of Native Americans and environmental activists who have camped on the property since Sunday oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline because they say it could adversely impact drinking water and would disturb sacred burial sites.
