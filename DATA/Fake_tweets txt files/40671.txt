Ukraine is capable of ruining many empires. A great deal of the Russian empire collapse was brought by intrigues played by the empire's ruling elites, originating in Ukraine. Dnepropetrovsk dynasty was governing the USSR. Once Ukrainian elites moved to the US's camp, an awful conflict among American elites has emerged. Whereas we follow the Ukrainian crisis as a civil war of our close people, Americans treat Ukraine as Guatemala or any other colony and protectorate. Suddenly it turned out that Ukrainian elites can influence US domestic policies. It all started when Petro Poroshenko finished off Trump's consultant Paul Manafort.
