Now the French police tries to find out whether intentional arson was a reason of the fire of Notre-Dame and if it was, who then stands behind this intention? There were already publications in which recent attacks on churches in France are listed. The question of whether these attacks are links of the same chain arises by itself.

It is already clear to many people that these acts are the work of the Islamic State. Destruction of others shrines is a common practice for Islamists. What to say here about France which continues to accept migrants from the Middle East and North Africa in thousands. Worse is coming.
