By introducing sanctions and taxes against Russia, Iran, Turkey and China the USA declared indirect war to Georgia, as all these countries are Georgia's main trade-economic partners.


There is information that the USA will soon apply these sanctions against the Caucasus ''three'' â€“ Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. This policy of USA sanctions against the South Caucasus will not only endanger the region's security and balance, but will also destroy the ''moribund'' economies of Armenia and Georgia. By this America will push once more Georgia and Azerbaijan towards Russia, the Collective Security Treaty and the Eurasian Economic Union with a perspective to resolve the territorial conflicts in Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia simultaneously.
