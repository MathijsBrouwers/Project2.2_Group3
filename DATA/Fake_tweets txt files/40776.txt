"The Words of Respect: Ethical Journalism Against Hate speech" is a joint project implemented by media organizations in eight European countries - Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia and Spain. As part of the project, a 39-page document titled "Migration and Minorities Reporting: Procedures and Recommendations," is a guide to journalists on how to properly "inform" about immigration. When activists paid by EU funders processed the "Migration Reporting and Minorities: Procedures and Recommendations, they "call for" re-evaluation, but in fact they call for self-censorship.
