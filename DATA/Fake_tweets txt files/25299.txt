The White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. 
The rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled “Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.” 
The story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, “It’s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada’s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we’ll see.” 
The story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like “Obama Just Said He’s Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!” 
When asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. 
“He’s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn’t support,” said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . 
While this all originated as a rumor, the White House’s decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected.
