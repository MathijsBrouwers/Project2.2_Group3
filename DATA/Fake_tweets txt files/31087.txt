Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Matt Ward Donald Trump tells UK: You should make Kate Bush the new Queen 
Kate Bush would make a magnificent queen for the United Kingdom, Donald Trump has suggested. 
The President-elect singled out the 58-year-old singer as the perfect candidate after watching a video of her 1980 hit Babooshka on YouTube.“I’m sure many people would like to see her represent Great Britain as their Monarch,” he told reporters following a Tweet in the middle of the night. 
“In that video, she looks equally good in a skin tight catsuit and a chain mail bikini. Not many women can pull that off. 
“Ok so she’s in her 50s now, but that kind of works for me. Plus Elizabeth is how old? A hundred and nine? Most people would see Kate Bush as a serious upgrade. 
“So to recap, stunning looks, great choice in bikinis, British. Face it: she ticks all the boxes.
