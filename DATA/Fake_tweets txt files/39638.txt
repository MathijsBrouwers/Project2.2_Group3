The Western countries showed that they are enemies of democracy when they protested against the elections in the DNR and LNR. The Western countries today are dictatorships. A dictatorship of liberalism, military bloc of NATO and that is our main threat today. There is pure democracy here in Donbas.

///

The Donbas elections are a lesson of democracy for all of Europe. // The West needs to learn from DNR how to organise elections

///

The Minsk agreements contribute to holding open and transparent elections that DNR and LNR want to organise.

///

Donbas elections comply with all the international standards.
