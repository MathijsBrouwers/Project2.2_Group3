The Ukrainian government intends to destroy the whole Russian-speaking population of Donetsk and Luhansk regions after the liberation of the territory and its return to Ukraine. The economic recovery and development of Donbas does not interest the Ukrainian authorities, so they intend to leave only burned land in this region. People who collaborated with the authorities of the "LDNR" militants are also subject to destruction.
