The United States decided to reformat the global security system in their favour. What is important here is the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Treaty). This decision was first mentioned by President Trump in October 2018. What is absolutely not surprising is that they had found “weighty” arguments to justify this decision. Allegedly, back in 2008, Russia developed a missile that can cover a distance of over 500 km. Moscow’s arguments that the “suspicious” missile 9M729 has a much smaller flight range have been simply ignored by Washington.
