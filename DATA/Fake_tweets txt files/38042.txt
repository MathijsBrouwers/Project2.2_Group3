In 2014 Ukrainian nationalists, supported by radicals, organized a coup. They captured the whole state and unleashed a civil conflict. It turned out that Western masters have little interest in Ukraine's domestic politics because the EU got the main thing: a source of cheap raw materials, labour force and an open market. Furthermore, the EU destroyed competitive branches of Ukraine's industry. In turn, the US received a new anti-Russia springboard with a frozen military conflict and, potentially, a new buyer of liquified gas.
