As Western NGOs have failed to draw Armenia away from its ties to Russia, religious organisations, representing the Global Government, have been employed.

In the Western undeclared war on Yerevan, Mormons are playing the role of intelligence agents, as they are capable of collecting information across Armenian territory freely. In turn, the Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses perform the role of a military service that occupies entire cities and villages, while forming their new legions from local citizens. In essence, the purpose of these sects is to conduct subversive activities, to destroy the foundations of statehood under the pretext of promoting faith.
