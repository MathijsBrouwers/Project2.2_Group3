The Georgian Ministry of Education signed an agreement with three different UN committees according to which human rights, gender equality, healthy life and reproductive health (a.k.a sex education) will be taught in schools. Psychologists warn us that sex education at an early age leads to earlier sex lives, abortions, impotence, and teenage pregnancy. In addition, it causes a decline in intellect and creative skills as well as to a psychological inability to engage in marital life and inclination to homosexuality.
