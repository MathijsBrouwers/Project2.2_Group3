Russia does not violate the INF Treaty and does not create dangerous weapons capable of carrying nuclear charges. The United States is the one violating international agreements on arms control while accusing Russia of everything in order to freely deploy missiles in Europe. NATOâ€™s position on the INF Treaty is ridiculous since Russia will comply with the treaty, but the Alliance will not.
