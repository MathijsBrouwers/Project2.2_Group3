Just days before the it’s time to vote our next President into the White House, the Clinton family get bad news, after bad news, after bad news. Now..guess what is happening? 
MORE bad news! 
However, bad news for the Clintons means good news for us. 
We all knew that Hillary was a scheming snake of corruption who loves nothing but power and money. However with each new hit that came her way in October, many of us were still shocked over the sheer madness of it all. 
Now, Wikileaks is giving Bill Clinton some time under the microscope of truth. 
Via The Daily Caller : 
Ira Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for “offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia.” 
“CHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,” Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks. 
Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It’s an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. 
“It’s highly illegal and it’s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,” Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
Of course! Classic Clinton crap… living the life of luxury on the backs of hardworking Americans. 
That’s what they do! Related Items
