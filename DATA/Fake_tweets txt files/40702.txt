The Security and Information Service of the Czech Republic wants to insert a paragraph in the forthcoming amendment to the Criminal Law, which prohibits the collection and scrutiny of public and non-binding information in the Czech Republic. The consequence of this law would be the elimination of alternative journalism in the Czech Republic in its entirety, because any critical article will be marked as criminal under this amendment to the law.
