Europe is not united. Relations between Russia and EU, between European countries are difficult. The reason is the presence of US. Everywhere.





EU doesn’t carry out its obligations within international agreements. For example in Ukraine, EU doesn’t keep pressure on Ukraine to follow the Minsk agreements, EU closes its eyes on situation in Donbas. EU recognised Guaido immediately in Venezuela. The case with Iran was Europe’s disgrace. And all is because of pressure from USA. It is true that Europe is tired of US dictates. EU wants to cooperate with Russia, Iran, and China. But the USA don’t allow it.
