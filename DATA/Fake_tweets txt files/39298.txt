The US has pushed  Russia to violate the INF Treaty.

By deploying the Aegis missile defence system the US has compelled Moscow to develop  the 9M729 missile system and violate the INF Treaty.

The Aegis missile defence system, deployed by the US  in Eastern Europe, violates the INF Treaty because it could also be used  offensively, to launch cruise missiles. A Pentagon report states that with only minor modifications the Aegis system can be transformed from a defensive into an offensive system.
