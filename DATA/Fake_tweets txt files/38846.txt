There is no evidence of Russian attempts to influence the EU parliamentary elections in May 2019.

The European establishment needs fake news about "external interference" in order to draw voters' attention to the upcoming elections and mobilise them.

With such advance declarations, the mainstream media tries to justify a possible defeat and the victory of the Eurosceptics. The latter could actually claim the formation of a strong group in the future European Parliament. If that happens, the elites will need someone to blame. Russia is already identified as the culprit.
