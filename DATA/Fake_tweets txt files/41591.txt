Allegations towards Russia in the downing of flight MH17 are groundless. Even to this day, no evidence has been provided - only empty claims.

Dutch prosecutors say that an investigation is underway, while Russia has already been asked for compensation. If we ask where the data from Ukrainian radars are, where the airlines' communications data are, where the American satellite images are, we get no answers. However, Russia still gets the blame.
