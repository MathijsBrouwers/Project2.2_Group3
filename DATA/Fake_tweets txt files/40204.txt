In the Volyn region of Ukraine, near Kovel, sand mixed with the remains of Nazi-shot Soviet prisoners of war was used for construction and finishing works.

Throughout 2017, this mixture was used for the construction of residential buildings, as well as, according to the chairman of the Volyn regional organization of veterans of Ukraine Alexander Bulavin, for plastering in the high school.

Activists called police to the construction sites, law enforcers recorded the presence of bones, but they did not act on it.Â Repeated appeals to the authorities did not lead to anything.

Those who tried to open the eyes of the public to this business, began to be harassed by the local media.
