UN Plan for World Government The “New Urban Agenda” 
Have you heard of the “New Urban Agenda”? You haven’t? Well, don’t worry about it then. After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you—right? Wrong! The United Nations has a plan for global governance. If you don’t know what global governance means, let’s just call it what it really is—world government. The overall plan is called Sustainable Development. Sustainable Development defines the goals that all nations should attain by 2030. The plan focuses largely on cities since a large percentage of the world’s population now lives in cities; thus the New Urban Agenda. The UN has a completely developed plan for world government and intends for every person on earth to be under its control. Will the United States become a part of the coming one-world government? That may depend on how we vote on November 8th. We’ll explain further on today’s edition of End of the Age.
