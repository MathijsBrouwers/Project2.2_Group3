On the 4th of March 2018 in Salisbury, former GRU agent Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned, causing a major international scandal. The British authorities have accused the Russian state of being involved in the  poisoning. After one year the Skripal case crumbles due to the lack of proof to indicate Russia’s guilt.
