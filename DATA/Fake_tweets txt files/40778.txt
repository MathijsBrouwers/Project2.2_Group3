In the Estonian military town of Tapa, a new military base was opened for NATO Defence Force soldiers and its construction cost 43 million euros. They want to deploy more military equipment near the Russian border. It was decided at the Warsaw summit in the summer of 2016, "allegedly in connection with the threat of Russia attack." Moscow stresses that "it does not intend to ever attack any NATO member." According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, NATO knows very well that there is no attack threat from Russia, but NATO uses the situation to deploy "more technicians and soldiers near the Russian border".
