A permanent political crisis is a reality for Moldova. A civil war which resulted in the establishment of the unrecognised Transnistrian Republic and the so called colour revolution of 2009 are manifestations of the crisis. The EU-Moldova Association Agreement (AA) has turned out to be very disadvantageous for Moldovans. After the signing, painful economic and political transformations took place in the country, yet Moldovans have not profited from the agreement except for the new possibilities to go to the EU in order to clean houses or care for the elderly in Italy.
