What should we expect [during presidential election in Russia]? [...] I mean the murder of one of the presidential candidates. Therefore, I would like to ask Russian authorities to protect these people as much as possible. They are really threatened!.One of the weakest critics, I mean. For example, Yavlinskiy, Sobchak and so on. [---] And who is doing this? Not simply Americans. This is being done by a specific consortium of intelligence services, which have escaped the control of the people of the United States, and which are doing it independently.
