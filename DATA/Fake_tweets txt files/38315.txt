Lithuania does not want to take a DNA test based on remains of Konstanty Kalinowski's brother who is buried in Belarus. This test would help to identify the remains which supposedly belong to the executed 1863 uprising leader.

The absence of DNA test will allow Lithuania to avoid a blunder as it can turn out that the remains belong to a different person. Moreover, by not taking the test Lithuania expects to have grounds for information war against Belarus with the use of Belarusian opposition to please Lithuania's nationalistic policies.
