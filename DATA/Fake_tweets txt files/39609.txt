Based on the documents that were shown, an obvious conclusion can be made that, having received a false statement from Magnitsky that was used for provocation, Browder was interested in Sergey Magnitsky's death more than anyone else in order to avoid exposure.

Moscow also suspects Browder of being involved in the murder of three men allegedly linked to his business – Octay Gasanov, Valery Kurochkin and Sergey Korobeinikov.

It is highly likely that they were killed to get rid of accomplices who could give an incriminating testimony against Browder.
