JUSTIN Bieber fans gathering outside the Shelborne hotel this evening were rewarded by the pop star after he took a large dump from an overlapping balcony, causing a stampede of adoring fans to gather below and smear themselves with the falling excrement. 
Men, women and children of all ages pushed and tugged each other as they desperately positioned themselves under the hotels three story window, while the 22-year-old squatted over the side, before then squeezing several pieces of spent food from his anus. 
“Let the younger ones through,” Bieber ordered fans, as he let loose for a third time while being supported by two large security guards, “Make sure everyone gets some. There’s enough to go round. 
“Rub it in. Sing with me ‘You know you love me, I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there'” he bellowed. 
Following several slips and falls, with one fan breaking her ankle, Gardai were later called to the scene and kindly asked the American heartthrob to stop defecating from the Shelbourne balcony and to go inside. 
“He must have been there for a good twenty minutes, just crapping on everyone,” eyewitness Mark Dunphy told WWN, “That young fella is full of shit. The fans lapped it up. I don’t think I’ll ever forget what I saw tonight”. 
Mr. Bieber is in town for a sold-out concert at Dublin’s 3Arena tonight and tomorrow as part of his Purpose world tour.
