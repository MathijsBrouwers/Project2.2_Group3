American Congress will monitor political parties in Europe which have a critical attitude towards the European Union or NATO. American intelligence service will investigate all the critical parties in Europe. Political parties suspected for those critical attitudes towards the EU, and those who are opposed to hosting nuclear warheads and NATO military build-up in Europe, may be sanctioned by the United States.
