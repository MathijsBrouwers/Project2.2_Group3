What we heard on March 1 [Putin's state of the nation address] is, perhaps, a scientific and technical version of the Munich speech [Putin's speech in Munich in 2007]. This is a technological Munich speech. And how should we name the missile [next-generation cruise missiles unveiled by Putin]? It can be called "The Peacemaker", for example. Because its purpose is to save peace. This is peace.
