Film director and actor Stanislav Baretsky claims that he in early 2000's was dating a girl, who was "working the hotels". The actor admits that he at the time was worshiping the girl and didn't care about her profession. His beloved decided to go for another man and left for Sweden, where she, according to Baretsky, gave birth to a girl that she left for adoption. [...] The woman from the past contacted Mr. Baretsky recently and declared that Greta is his daughter.
