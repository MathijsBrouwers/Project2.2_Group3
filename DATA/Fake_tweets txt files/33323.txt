DEEP UNDERGROUND BASES & THE SATANIC BREAKAWAY STATE — Dr. Richard Sauder Published on Sep 30, 2016 With more than $6.5 TRILLION missing from the Pentagon and countless top secret deep underground military and government bases scattered across the United States, it’s clear that the deep state – or breakaway civilization – is taking our nation, and the world, in a very dangerous direction. Author Dr. Richard Sauder joins me to discuss his studied work in this area, work which has led Sauder to conclude, “This is a battle for the planet and the brood of vipers has set up its nest within the bowels of the so-called United States and so-called United States military and the associated alphabet soup agencies.” 
NOTE: Richard is living in Ecuador and could use our help. If you would like to donate to Richard, any amount will help. Richards writes: 
Here is how people can donate to me: 
1) People can send me Amazon.com gift cards at dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com using the link: https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Amazon-… 
2) I can receive Bitcoin at: 1Dht92qEzCmvuLRKQD2MSJ1JdQ7rFRMVdA 
Those are the easiest ways. I do not have a bank account and cannot feasibly get one at present. 
3) I can also receive modest non-bank money transfers, but people should e-mail me at dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com for the details as to how to do that. 
Best regards,
