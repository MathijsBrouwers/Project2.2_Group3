Dr. Eowyn | 1 Comment . . for FOTM’s 135th Caption Contest! 
I think this was a quite difficult and challenging contest, which is reflected in the number and quality of entries. 
That being said, the top captions are all really funny. 
As usual, FOTM ‘s writers duly voted, each for what he/she considered to be the best (#1) and second-best (#2) captions. Each #1 vote is worth 4 points; each #2 vote is worth 2 points. 
And the winner of FOTM ’s 135th Caption Contest, with two #1 votes and one #2 vote, totaling 10 points, is . . . youknowwho! 
Here’s the winning caption: Hillary won?!?!? I’m outta here. 
Dan and drmrs are in 2nd place, each with one #1 vote and one #2 vote, totaling 6 points each. Here are their respective captions: 
“…so now that you’ve heard all the details of my transitioning from Chastity to Chuck…” 
I need those 72 virgins now to relieve the stress of this infidel. 
Lola is in 3rd place, with one #1 vote and 4 points. Here is her caption: 
“As Hillary tells us, we are Stronger Together.” 
MomOfIV and Timewavvs are in 4th place, each with one #2 vote and 2 points. Here are their respective captions: 
Ahmed had the misfortune of being seated next to a pompous CNN anchor who talks nonstop of how great Hillary Clinton is…..
