Under NATO patronage, a joint military exercise, ‘Albanian Power 19’, is being held in Albania: It's participants are precisely those countries in the region that Pristina at several occasions in the past few months have summoned to unite against Serbia's policies.
Albanian, Croatian, Northern Macedonian, Montenegrin and Bulgarian forces, together with the so-called Kosovan Army, are practicing at the military base “Bize” in Albania under the patronage of US, UK, German, Italian, Turkish and Polish instructors.
There is no doubt that this is just the first proof in a row of formation of a pact against Serbia.
