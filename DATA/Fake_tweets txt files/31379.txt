Russia has launched the latest addition to its series of super-stealth diesel-electric submarines, the Veliky Novgorod, which sports advanced stealth technologies and increased combat range. 
The latest addition to the Black Sea Fleet is capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets and was officially launched from St. Petersburg’s Admiralty Shipyard on Wednesday in the presence of Russian Navy Deputy Commander Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Fedotenkov, and Admiralty Shipyard CEO Alexander Buzakov. 
Earlier this month, Buzakov had said that another Varshavyanka-class submarine, the Kolpino, would be launched in November. A screen grab from footage published by Ruptly on October 26, 2016 shows the launch of Russia’s Veliky Novgorod super-stealth diesel-electric submarine. 
“The state tests of the fifth [Varshavyanka-class] submarine, the Veliky Novgorod, were successfully completed and on October 25 it will be handed over to the Black Sea Fleet. The transfer of the sixth submarine, the Kolpino, is underway, scheduled to be completed on November 25," he said. 
The submarines, which are designed for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations in mid- depth waters, are capable of holding a crew of 52, have a top underwater speed of 20 knots and a cruising range of 400 miles. They can stay submerged for 45 days and are armed with 18 torpedoes and eight surface-to-air projectiles.
