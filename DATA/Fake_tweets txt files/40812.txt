This might be preparation for the final solution of the Russian question one way or another. If you want to destroy someone, you must turn him into an absolute symbol of Evil. They turned Saddam Hussein into that. Turned Milosevic. Now, like that, they are not dehumanizing Putin. They are dehumanizing Russia. In today's Western propaganda, we are an absolute Evil, like the Jews were for the Nazis! And it wasn't an accident that [the West] brought Ukrainian Nazis to power. This is a real preparation for the aggression [against Russia].
