One of the main reasons behind Crimeaâ€™s destabilisation is the Majlis of the Crimean Tatars. The leaders of (the currently banned) Majlis provoke acts of crime and terrorism from abroad. The Majlis was illegal even in Ukraine and majorly corrupted. The Mejlis leaders are parts of the plans of the Ukrainian regime. Crimean Tatar leaders are supporting the persecution of their own people because they turn a blind eye to the ongoing "ethnocultural genocide".
