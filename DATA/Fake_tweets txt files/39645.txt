"Ukrainians in the Polish Army in 1612 allegedly seized Moscow (...) Of course it was a big government, a commonwealth, with Poles and Lithuanians, there could have been people who weren’t Poles, and those who would later call themselves Ukrainians, but in 1612 the word ‘Ukraine’ was not heard anywhere", said Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.
