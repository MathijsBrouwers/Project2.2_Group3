Who in the last 6 years considered the opinion of the Ukrainian people? There is the opinion of the US, the EU, oligarchs and Soros whom Honcharuk serves. All of them are only using the Ukrainian people and especially Honcharuk. His mission is to stop the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine so that the US can sell its own liquefied gas, and steal everything from the people. After that Ukraine can be closed as a project.
