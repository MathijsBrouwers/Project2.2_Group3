Churches in France began to burn after the new year and about a dozen have already burned down, many more have been desecrated. But the police spoke about the burning of temples by anarchists, not migrants, and there is a big difference there.

The Notre Dame fire was not an accident. In general, all these arsons and desecrations are the work of the special services. The mystery is only if it was done by the French or the American intelligence services.

Europe's weakness is well within the sphere of US interests. And so the burning of churches in France is quite a reason for new protests.
