At present, it is as hard for the West to "sell" G8 membership to Russia as it was impossible to "sell" Ukraine to Russia after the 2014 coup. This does not mean Russia did not really want to get it. Russia just asked for concrete terms of the deal whereas the West wanted to have its hands free.

For Moscow, it was inconceivable a decade ago to put in question the need to take part in the G8, whereas today, this is reality. Back in the 1990s, Moscow had to seek the West's favour. At present, the West needs Russia as it has turned into a global leader. Without Russia's membership, any organisation including the Council of Europe cannot pretend to have European or global status.
