U.N. declares junk food a 'human rights' issue Says countries failing to meet globally agreed upon nutrition targets Published: 9 mins ago 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.N. expert says junk food is a human rights concern. 
Hilal Elver, the U.N.’s special representative on the right to food, said Tuesday the rise of industrial food production combined with trade liberalization has allowed large corporations to flood the global market with cheap, nutrient-poor foods that force poor people to choose between economic viability and nutrition, effectively violating their right to adequate food. 
“Within the human rights framework, states are obliged to ensure effective measures to regulate the food industry, ensure that nutrition policymaking spaces are free from private sector influence and implement comprehensive policies that combat malnutrition in all its forms,” she said.
