George Soros's agencies are taking control over Slovakia. The third sector (managed by Soros) is controlling the political development and therefore the priorities of the Slovak state policies. The third sector (incl. Open Society Foundation), has projects running in order to e.g. privatise state property, destroy the pension scheme system and medical care, destroy culture and lower the educational level of the population.
