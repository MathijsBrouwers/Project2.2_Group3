October 26, 2016 Another UNESCO vote to disregard Jewish connection to Jerusalem 
In recent days, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acted to achieve the support of the 21 countries to vote against the expected condemnations, but sources in Jerusalem say that the results are already clear, and the committee will almost certainly pass the draft resolution against Israel. 

According to those same sources, the reason for this is that “troublesome” composition of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee. Countries like Germany, Colombia and Japan, who were part of the committee last year, left and have been replaced by notoriously anti-Israeli countries like Kuwait, Lebanon and Indonesia. 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the scheduled vote and said, “This is the continuation of the theatre of the absurd. Who’s really deserving of condemnation is UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee, not Israel.”
