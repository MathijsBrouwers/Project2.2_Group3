With deer hunting season upon us, Arby's has decided to get in on the action. 
In select locations across six states, the fast food chain will sell the “Venison Sandwich” for three day stints at each restaurant from Oct. 31 to Nov. 28. 
Chief marketing officer Rob Lynch, who calls venison “incredibly delicious,” explains in an official press release that Arby's is not afraid to take “risks” when it comes to trying new things.

He states: 
"We’re a brand that’s not afraid to take risks, and while the venison sandwich is probably the biggest stretch for us yet, it’s incredibly delicious and we can’t wait to get it in the hands of our guests. You won’t leave a hunt empty-handed after stopping by Arby’s.” 
The 100% venison sandwiches will be made with “premium cut top and bottom round steaks from the hind quarter of the deer.” Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Georgia are the states that will be serving them up. 
So what exactly will this Venison Sandwich taste like? 
Arby's describes it like this: 
“The Venison Sandwich at Arby’s features a thick-cut venison steak and crispy onions topped with a juniper berry sauce on a toasted specialty roll. The venison is marinated in garlic, salt and pepper and then cooked for three hours to juicy, tender perfection. The juniper berry sauce is a Cabernet steak sauce infused with juniper berries, giving the already unique sandwich another signature twist.”
