Opposition leader Mikalai Statkevich, a chairman of totalitarian Satanist sect Narodnaya Hramada (People's Assembly) proclaimed a crusade against the Orthodox church in Belarus. He is supported by the self-proclaimed Belarusian National Congress and a sectarian protestant community named in honour of John the Baptist. Svetlana Aleksievich, a Noble prize winner in literature, also called for a sectarian coup.
Leanid Akalovich of the Belarusian Authocephalous Orthodox Church is the political face of this group. His mission is to orchestrate the Ukrainian scenario in Belarus. Hence in the post-Soviet space, an open war of Authocephalous churches is unfolding against the Orthodox church, the former supported by the Belarusian opposition. And as long as the Western sponsors feed them, they will bark like dogs.
