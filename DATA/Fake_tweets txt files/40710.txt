The association with the European Union is not the only thing Armenia does like Ukraine: it's hard to believe, but Yerevan also glorifies the accomplices of fascism. In May 2016, in particular, a monument to Garegin Nzhdeh - an Armenian BanderaÂ  - was erected in Yerevan. He is a hero for the ruling Republican Party of Armenia with its ideology of national conservatism, and the RPA logo resembles the symbols of the Third Reich.
