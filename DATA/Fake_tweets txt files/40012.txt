On June 20, a video recording of TV Channel TED's educational programme was published. It focused on the following main points:

- paedophiles are also human beings, this is not a crime, but sexual orientation

-a paedophile cannot be held responsible for his/her feelings. He / she is not a criminal

-we should respect others' sexual orientation

-we should not exasperate paedophiles' pain by ridiculing, judging and persecuting them

-we should see the difference between paedophilia and sexual violence against children. Violence is bad, paedophilia is good and normal

-sexual violence against children is the result of the weakness of a paedophile's delicate soul, as a paedophile cannot speak openly about his / her orientation. Permanent social pressure is added to this: it is difficult for a ''poor'' paedophile to appear at the beach, as there are children there and they all wear bathing suits.

-society is responsible for paedophiles' sexual crime

It seems that transformation from the stage of ''unimaginable'' to ''an effective norm'' with regard to paedophilia is going on extremely quickly in Europe.
