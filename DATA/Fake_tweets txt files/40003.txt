Stroke of pigs: Pentagon is working out a biological war strategy in the Baltics.

The Baltic states help Pentagon to develop biological weapon for the WWIII - the role of guinea pigs is reserved for them.

Mosaic outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in Eastern Europe are gradually forming a general picture of the testing ground at which the Pentagon is working out the strategy and tactics of the third world war (biological). Probably, in this coordinate system a special role is assigned to the Eastern vanguard of NATO - the Baltic countries, which can be sacrificed. Believe me, conspiracy here does not smell - the facts are obvious.
