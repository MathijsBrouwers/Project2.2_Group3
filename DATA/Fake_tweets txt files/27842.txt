Fox News is busy feeding their viewers the dream of a Trump comeback, but that’s to be expected. 
Fox News is the channel that brought you Dick Morris predicting Mitt Romney’s victory and Karl Rove’s election night flip out over Obama’s win in 2012. 
One of the sure signs that a voters are close to a definitive outcome in a presidential election is when some in the media start trying to gin up a comeback for the trailing candidate. With the exception of Fox News and other conservative outlets, media like CNN go down this path because they see interest waning in the election, so they are looking to boost ratings with some artificial drama. 
Like clockwork, some in the press are cooking up the comeback kid narrative. 
Don’t fall for it. Trust numbers. Trust facts, and trust voting results. The rest of it is the standard nonsense that gets pulled every election year when the networks begin to see their election bounce end and ratings decline.
