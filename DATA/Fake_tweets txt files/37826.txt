Colour revolution techniques increasingly manifest in the continued protests in Tbilisi. It is a strange coincidence that Mike Carpenter, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, tweeted about the possible negative consequences of the open door policy of the current Georgian government in relations with Russia just a couple days before the scandal in the Georgian parliament took place. Carpenter is one of the Kyiv Maidan curators who was later in charge of Ukraine's external governance.

Washington curators of the 'sanitary zone' along Russian borders are unhappy about the normalisation of Georgian-Russian relations. They need the heaviest possible anti-Russian policies from post-Soviet countries. Any sovereign decision of Georgia disliked by the US, be it non-alignment with Western sanctions over Russia or abolition of visas for Russian tourists, risk provoking a colour revolution. Professional regime changers work on making the Belarusian government pro-Western in order to achieve a revolution in Belarus too.

Last year, Carpenter visited Belarus allegedly in the framework of restoring relations with the West. Over 20 years, the West has created all infrastructure necessary for a regime change in Belarus. Dozens of media outlets, NGOs, political parties, etc. function on American and European money. All of them can mobilise their audiences and employees to take part in mass riots at any moment.
