The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, known as the “Salisbury incident”, was provoked by the UK government as part of  a “dead cat strategy” aimed at diverting public attention from its Brexit-associated problems and at demonising Russia.

The UK government has never provided any credible and verifiable proof of Russia’s involvement in the Skripals’ poisoning. All accusations against Russia turned out to be groundless.

The government of Theresa May has always ignored the repeated proposals by the Russian side for constructive cooperation in the investigation of this case.
