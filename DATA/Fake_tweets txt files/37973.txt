Many facts presented in the Chernobyl series are completely wrong. Half the staff of the plant is shown to be idiotic, the administration is generally weak, it is insulting.

The idea comes up that the series aims to damage the reputation of Rosatom, which for 15 years has taken 67% of the global nuclear construction market. Fiction remains fiction despite all the efforts to pretend to be a documentary.
