Looking at the face, modus operandi and weapons of the shooter in the Christchurch terror attack, one can recognise the same psychological type of Ukrainian nationalists. If the West turns a blind eye to the crimes of the Ukrainian nationalists, these kind of events will repeat themselves in every Western country. If Europe stays blind to nationalists in "vyshyvankah" (Ukrainian national costume) who are shouting fascist slogans, their followers will continue committing acts of terror.
