Macron thinks that NATO was conceived as a response to the enemy, as a response to the Warsaw Pact. The situation is actually exactly the opposite. NATO's birthday is 4 April 1949. This means that less than four years after the World War II ended, former Allies of the USSR in the fight against fascism have created against the USSR a military bloc, where apart from the US entered France, the UK, Canada, Benelux countries, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Portugal. And only six years later, in response to this, Warsaw Pact was formed on 14 May 1955, as a counterweight to NATO. Apart from the USSR, the Pact included Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

So, when Macron says that NATO was thought as a "response to the enemy", it is actually exactly the opposite: it was thought as a threat to a friend, with whom they fought against fascism and with whom they were setting up post-war life in Europe. And if so, then the creation of NATO was not justified at all.
