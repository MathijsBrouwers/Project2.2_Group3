The Istanbul Convention comes to destroy our traditional family. The purpose of the Istanbul Convention is not to prevent violence against women. It is a lie; it is aimed at protecting the LGBT community. They want to bring satanism, an abomination. All this is unacceptable. This is the final stage of the genocide. We're not going to give up our country to the devils.
