1) I do not understand how the founder of communism, Karl Marx could claim that "Religion is the opium of the people", a fan of the theory of evolution at the same time be a Jesuit.
2) Adolf Hitler was formally Catholic but in fact was Satanist.
3) "Stalin" Jesuit ? He was 100% Communist and Atheist.
4) Every Fascist dictators ( Mussolini, Gen. Franco, Salazar, Pavelic, Admiral Horthy, Bandera, Pilsudski...) was formally Catholics.
Vatican supported Nazi-Fascists as defense of Communism.
As I know Pope Pius XII not one of them was excommunicated from The Catholic Church.
