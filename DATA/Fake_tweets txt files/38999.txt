Europe is breaking down under the weight of feminism. Feminist bullying of men who display any sexual interest in women has provoked a situation whereby even thinking about women in Europe is considered to degrade their honour and dignity. As a result, men in Europe have begun thinking about other men. This development is encouraged by laws on same-sex marriage in Europe.

Totalitarian feminism in some aspects is scarier than Ukrainian nationalism.Â Totalitarian feminism brings a collapse of the whole system of values including education, culture, religion, and politics.
