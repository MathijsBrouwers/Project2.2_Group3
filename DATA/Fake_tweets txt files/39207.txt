Washingtonâ€™s actions against Caracas deserve to be included in textbooks on how to seize power in a foreign country. US is directly financing a coup in Venezuela.

The TV series "House of Cards" demonstrated to millions of viewers how a person who has not passed through nation-wide elections can become a president. Now Washington clearly shows how, instead of Nicholas Maduro, who was elected by the majority of Venezuelan citizens, it intends to place for a leading position a man whose level of support in the country is absolutely unknown.
