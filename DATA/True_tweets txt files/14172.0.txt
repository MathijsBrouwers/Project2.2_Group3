Ukraine s EU membership ambitions will collide with the West s reform demands at a summit on Friday with EU leaders ready to admonish Kiev for failing to implement anti-corruption laws that would bring it closer to the West, officials say. European Union leaders gathering in Brussels for the biennial  Eastern Partnership  summit with Ukraine and five other former Soviet republics are worried Kiev has lost interest in the reforms it began with zeal after its pro-European uprising in 2014. At stake for Kiev is new funding to rebuild the corruption-ridden economy, including a possible donors  conference, more EU  financial-sector aid and a Lithuanian-led push for 10-year development fund.  We have to show some tough love because friendly advice isn t working  said a senior EU official preparing the summit with Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Belarus.  Ukraine is the highest-profile test of the EU s 15-year-old policy to build an outer ring of market democracies from the Caucasus to the Sahara without offering EU membership. Backed by Washington, the strategy has so far worked by rewarding President Petro Poroshenko with attention, visa-free travel for Ukrainians and a free-trade deal with the EU.  But Ukraine remains perceived as one of the world s most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International, ranked 131 out of 176 countries in 2016.  Olena Halushka of the non-governmental Anti-Corruption Action Centre in Kiev said the political elite was now trying to  fake  the reforms agreed with Western donors, including energy, judicial and police overhauls.   We are also witnessing attempts to roll back the achievements,  she said of Poroshenko s reforms since 2014. EU leaders are expected to  acknowledge the European aspirations  of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova in a summit statement
