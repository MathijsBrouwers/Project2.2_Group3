President Vladimir Putin inaugurated a monument to the victims of Stalinist purges on Monday, but Soviet-era dissidents accused him of cynicism at a time when they say authorities are riding roughshod over civil freedoms.  The Wall of Grief  occupies a space on the edge of Moscow s busy 10-lane ring road and depicts a mass of faceless victims, many of whom were sent to prison camps or executed on Josef Stalin s watch after falsely being accused of being  enemies of the people.  Nearly 700,000 people were executed during the Great Terror of 1937-38, according to conservative official estimates.    An unequivocal and clear assessment of the repression will help to prevent it being repeated,  Putin said at the opening ceremony.  This terrible past must not be erased from our national memory and cannot be justified by anything.  His words and the ceremony amounted to one of his strongest condemnations of the Soviet Union s dark side in the 18 years  he has dominated Russia s political landscape.    Putin has in the past called Stalin  a complex figure  and said attempts to demonise him were a ploy to attack Russia. But at Monday s ceremony, he said there were lessons for Russia.  It doesn t mean demanding accounts be settled,  said Putin, who stressed a need for stability.  We must never again push society to the dangerous precipice of division.  Putin s carefully balanced words reflect Kremlin unease over this year s centenary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which paved the way for Stalin s rise. Uncomfortable about promoting discussion of the idea of governments being overthrown by force, the Kremlin is not organizing any commemorative events. Putin, who is expected to run for and win the presidency again in March, told human rights activists earlier on Monday that he hoped the centenary would allow society to draw a line under the tumultuous events of 1917 and to accept Russia s history
