Saudi Arabia is celebrating the 87th anniversary of its foundation this weekend with a big program of concerts and performances, including a pageant operetta on Saturday evening which allowed women to enter the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh for the first time.     The festivities are part of a government move to boost national pride and improve quality of life for Saudis.      Also on offer is a concert in the Red Sea city of Jeddah featuring 11 Arab musicians, plus fireworks, air acrobatics and traditional folk dance shows.      It is the first time I have come to the stadium and I feel like more of a Saudi citizen. Now I can go everywhere in my country,  said 25-year-old Sultana, green and white flags painted on both cheeks as she entered the complex with her girlfriends.      God willing, tomorrow women will be permitted bigger and better things like driving and travel.      Several thousand families entered the stadium
