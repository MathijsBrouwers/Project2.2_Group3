Wading through highways swamped by turbid waters that sloshed over scattered, sunken belongings, residents of this Puerto Rican barrio flooded by Hurricane Maria have begun emerging from their shattered homes.

Stranded cars stood half-sunk in driveways and satellite dishes tilted towards the sky to receive signals that had gone.  I peeked my head out during the storm and felt the wind
