Northern Ireland will not stay in the European Union s single market or the customs union after Brexit, a British government official said, adding that arrangements for the border with Ireland must not eat into the United Kingdom s integrity. Allowing Northern Ireland to retain some access has been floated by the European Parliament s Brexit pointman, Guy Verhofstadt.  We will leave the European Union in 2019 as one United Kingdom,  the British minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said on Monday.  We need to ensure that nothing is done that undermines the integrity of the UK single market.   I find it difficult to image how Northern Ireland could somehow remain in while the rest of the country leaves. I find it impossible,  he told a seminar in Brussels. Brokenshire reiterated Prime Minister Theresa May s insistence that the United Kingdom would be exiting both as a result of the 2016 referendum.  London has proposed an  invisible border  without checkpoints or immigration controls between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. But it has given no firm ideas on customs arrangements and the EU has mostly been critical, seeing these plans as unrealistic. Dublin has said it will not let Brexit negotiations move from the divorce talks to discussions about future trade relations between Britain and the EU
