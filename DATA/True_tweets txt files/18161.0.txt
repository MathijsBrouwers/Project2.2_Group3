Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike s new party on Friday unveiled an election platform that seeks to distance her  Yurinomics  policies from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s aggressive stimulus, by cutting reliance on fiscal spending and monetary easing.  Launched less than two week s ago, Koike s  Party of Hope  will take on Abe s ruling coalition in a national election called for Oct. 22.  It has made populist calls to freeze a scheduled sales tax hike in 2019 and phase out nuclear power, in an effort to set itself apart from the government on key issues, but the fresh approach on the economy was given its own catchy name.  We ll carry out  Yurinomics  that brings out private sector vitality, without relying excessively on monetary easing and fiscal spending,  the Party of Hope said.  While maintaining the Bank of Japan s massive monetary easing for the time being, the government and the BOJ should work together to seek a smooth exit strategy,  it added.  Yurinomics  is a piece of political branding to counter  Abenomics
