Leaders of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative party agreed on Sunday to pursue a  grand coalition  with the Social Democrats (SPD) to break the political deadlock in Europe s biggest economy.  Merkel, whose fourth term was plunged into doubt a week ago when three-way coalition talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens collapsed, was handed a political lifeline by the SPD on Friday. Under intense pressure to preserve stability and avoid new elections, the SPD reversed its position and agreed to talk to Merkel, raising the prospect of a new grand coalition, which has ruled for the past four years, or a minority government.  We have the firm intention of having an effective government,  Daniel Guenther, conservative premier of the state of Schleswig Holstein, told reporters after a four-hour meeting of leading members of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU).  We firmly believe that this is not a minority government but that it is an alliance with a parliamentary majority. That is a grand coalition,  he said. The meeting came after the conservative state premier of Bavaria threw his weight behind a new right-left tie-up.  An alliance of the conservatives and SPD is the best option for Germany
