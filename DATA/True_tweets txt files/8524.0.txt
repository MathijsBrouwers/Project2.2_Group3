Republican Donald Trump acted to steer his White House campaign back into favor with his party’s establishment on Friday by endorsing U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two Republican senators seeking re-election, after expressing coolness toward them earlier this week. “I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make,” Trump said during a rally in Green Bay, in northern Wisconsin, Ryan’s home state. He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a “rising star.” “We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends,” Trump said,  Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was “not quite there yet”
