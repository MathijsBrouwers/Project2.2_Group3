In an era of shrinking government contributions to development financing and “exploding” loan demand in poor countries, World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim is looking to the private sector for help. And he said U.S. President Donald Trump likes the idea. Kim told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he is looking to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars now parked in low-yield government bonds for development finance, earning higher returns for investors. The World Bank would pave the way to reduce risk. “Speaking with President Trump directly, I told him about the need to make this shift, to work more effectively with the private sector. He was very enthusiastic about that,” Kim said.     “I’d love to see President Trump champion this approach to development finance.” The potential new business model is part of Kim’s pitch to promote the multilateral lender’s role as a facilitator in developing new markets
