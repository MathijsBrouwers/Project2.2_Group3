Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday blasted currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on trade. Asked about the European Central Bank’s decision on Thursday to cut interest rates, Trump told CNBC that such devaluations were driving manufacturing and other jobs outside of the United States. “We just sit back and do nothing,” Trump said. “That’s getting to be very dangerous as far as I’m concerned.” A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said. “China is the grand master of all,” Trump said. “I have great relationships and business relationships with China, and even those people say they can’t believe what they’re getting away with.” Additionally, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election said that while he supports free trade if it is “fair,” the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations. Trump also said if elected president he would move quickly to stop corporate inversions
