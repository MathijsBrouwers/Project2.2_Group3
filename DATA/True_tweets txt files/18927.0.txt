Indonesian authorities are preparing to divert flights to 10 airports across the country in case an increasingly active volcano on the holiday island of Bali erupts and disrupts travel. Officials have warned that Mount Agung in eastern Bali could erupt at any time, prompting several countries including Australia and Singapore to issue travel advisor for one of the world s most popular tourist destinations.  Ten airports will serve as alternatives for flights bound for Bali s Ngurah Rai airport in case it is closed because of volcanic ash,  Transportation Minister Budi Karya said in a statement on Wednesday. Authorities are also preparing ferries to help people leave Bali in case air travel is disrupted, Karya said.  Airports in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Lombok are among those being prepared to allow diverted flights to land.  Bali s Ngurah Rai International Airport is the second-busiest in the country, after Jakarta s main international airport. It was operating normally on Wednesday. Nearly five million people visited Bali last year
