Police said the cause of the blast was still uncertain.  A  huge tremor  was felt in the vicinity when it hit, CGTN, a network operated by CCTV, wrote on Twitter.  The force of the explosion destroyed the roofs of two buildings at the site of the blast, which CCTV said were already structurally unsound.  It also shattered windows and punched holes in the walls of some residential and commercial properties as far as a kilometer away.  Images from CCTV also showed a few flattened cars and a low-rise building with a collapsed wall.  The state broadcaster said two people were killed, while 16 were slightly wounded and two were in serious condition.
