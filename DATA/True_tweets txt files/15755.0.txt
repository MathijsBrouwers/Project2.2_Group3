The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Friday said she would seek approval to open a formal investigation into allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan, in a case that could examine the role of U.S. forces abroad. Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that there is a  reasonable basis to believe  war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed and that all sides in the conflict would be examined. The prosecutor will focus on crimes allegedly committed since May 2003 on the territory of Afghanistan, and war crimes closely linked to the situation in Afghanistan allegedly committed since July 2002 on the territory of other states. The prosecutor on Friday did not mention any specific parties to be investigated. In a report last year, ICC prosecutors identified  potential cases  among three groups of alleged perpetrators: the Taliban and its affiliates, the Afghan authorities and members of the U.S. armed forces and Central Intelligence Agency. There were preliminary grounds to believe U.S. forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan and at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004, it said. The alleged atrocities took place in all 34 of Afghanistan s provinces, with a smaller number of crimes alleged in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where suspected members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda were held for questioning. If authorized by the court s judges, prosecutors will investigate  in an independent, impartial and objective way, crimes within the court s jurisdiction allegedly committed by any party to the armed conflict.   The ultimate focus will be upon those most responsible for the most serious crimes,  she said in the statement. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world s permanent court for prosecuting the most serious war crimes, including genocide. It has the backing of the European Union and dozens of nations, but several of the world s most powerful countries
