Leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom urged social media companies on Wednesday to more swiftly remove  terrorist content  from the internet, with the aim of stopping it from being uploaded in the first place.  The tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online,  British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly of world leaders in New York. She said there was a need  to increase significantly the efforts to stop (extremist content) being uploaded in the first place.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni later pushed in a separate event hosted by May for such content to be removed swiftly.  This is what must be done. In one hour the content must be identified, analyzed and withdrawn to avoid it being broadcast widely. Experience shows that this is possible,  said Macron, speaking through an interpreter.  We have a real battlefield for hearts and minds and (it) is the web,  Gentiloni said. He said economic and privacy issues were a hurdle in this process,  but we also have to know, if we are aware of the fact that this battlefield is so relevant, that we can t reduce our ambition because of the difficulties.
