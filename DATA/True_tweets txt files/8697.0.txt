U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his strongest support yet for Donald Trump’s White House bid on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention, saying the New York businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides America “a chance at a better way.”  Behind the scenes in Cleveland, the highest-ranking elected Republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and Republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by Trump’s candidacy. The support reflects deep divisions within the party over Trump’s harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt American workers but establishment Republicans view as central to their free trade policies. The split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of Trump and Ryan.  “Everybody knows the tough spot Paul Ryan is in,” said Annie Dickerson, a New York delegate to the convention and close adviser to Republican financier Paul Singer, referring to Ryan’s dilemma in backing a candidate as the party’s standard bearer in the Nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values. “He’s the antidote to all the frustration that’s in Cleveland this week,” she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with Trump’s nomination. Ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which Trump was officially nominated on Tuesday. But he has kept a low profile, avoiding the convention’s opening day on Monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of Republican supporters, according to aides and attendees. At the meetings, according to attendees, Ryan has been pushing his “Better GOP” platform, a six-part agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism President George W. Bush advocated
