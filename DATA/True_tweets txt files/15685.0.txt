Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative Party has suspended a lawmaker over what it said were serious allegations, a step that could undermine the authority of her minority government as Britain seeks to iron out a Brexit deal with the European Union. May s Conservative Party refused to give any detail about the nature of the allegations against Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative lawmaker for Dover in southern England, but said it had referred the matter to the police. Elphicke, formerly a tax lawyer who was first elected in 2010, denied any wrongdoing.  The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension,  he said on Twitter.  I am not aware of what the alleged claims are and deny any wrongdoing.  May s office did not respond to calls from Reuters about the allegations, whose nature was unclear. Email enquiries went unanswered. The Conservatives declined to comment. May s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party are grappling with a slew of sexual harassment and abuse claims
