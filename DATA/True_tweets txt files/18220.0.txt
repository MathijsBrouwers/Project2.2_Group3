It was meant to be the speech that rescued Theresa May s premiership, but her public humiliation before the assembled Conservative Party has thrust her own future into doubt. And, just as she tries to revive Brexit talks. May s authority was already shattered by her botched bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament just days before the opening of formal Brexit talks with the European Union. But her survival has been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the split party around Brexit and fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.
