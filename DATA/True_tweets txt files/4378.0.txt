The Syrian presidency said a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian army air base in Homs had increased Syria’s resolve to defeat insurgent groups, vowing to step up the pace of operations against them. “This aggression has increased Syria’s resolve to hit those terrorist agents, to continue to crush them, and to raise the pace of action to that end wherever they area,” a statement from the presidency said. The statement described the U.S. attack as rash and irresponsible and showing Washington was “naively pulled behind a false propaganda campaign”
