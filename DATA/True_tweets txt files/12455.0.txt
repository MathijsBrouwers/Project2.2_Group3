A top U.N. official recounted to the Security Council on Tuesday  heartbreaking and horrific accounts of sexual atrocities  by Myanmar soldiers against Rohingya Muslim women, urging the body to visit the region and demand an end to attacks on civilians.  Pramila Patten, special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on sexual violence in conflict, said one woman told her she was held by Myanmar troops for 45 days and raped repeatedly, while another woman could no longer see out of one eye after it was bitten by a soldier during a sexual assault.  Some witnesses reported women and girls being tied to either a rock or a tree before multiple soldiers raped them to death,  Patten told the Security Council.   Some women recounted how soldiers drowned babies in the village well. A few women told me how their own babies were allegedly thrown in the fire as they were dragged away by soldiers and gang raped,  she said.  Patten said the 15-member Security Council should visit Myanmar
