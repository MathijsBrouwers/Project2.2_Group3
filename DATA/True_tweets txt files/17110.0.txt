Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported. Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.  I don t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,  Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.  Trump s stupidity should not distract us from America s  deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.  Trump s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord
