The European Union does not share Turkey s view that the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen is a terrorist organization and would need to see  substantive  evidence to change its stance, the EU s counter-terrorism coordinator said. The comments by Gilles de Kerchove are likely to infuriate Ankara, which accuses Gulen of masterminding a failed military coup last year, in which more than 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied the charge and condemned the coup. Turkey has long accused its NATO allies, including the United States and Germany, of failing to condemn the abortive putsch strongly enough, saying they appeared more concerned by Ankara s ensuing crackdown on suspected supporters of the coup.  As for FETO, we don t see it as a terrorist organization, and I don t believe the EU is likely to change its position soon,  Kerchove said, using the Turkish government s acronym for Gulen s network.  You need not only circumstantial evidence
