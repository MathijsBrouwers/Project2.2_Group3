Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, an African-American who became a staunch critic of the “Black Lives Matter” movement and supported Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, said on Wednesday he has accepted a job as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Clarke told radio station WISN in Milwaukee that he would leave his post as sheriff next month to join the Department of Homeland Security. The post would not require Senate confirmation. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said no announcement on Clarke had been made, and said the role of assistant secretary must be made official by the secretary of the department.  Clarke said on WISN’s Vicki McKenna Show, “I’ll be a liaison with state and local governments and with the private sector, and one that’s really near and dear to me
