British Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to appoint a new defense minister on Thursday after her ally Michael Fallon quit in a sexual harassment scandal that has prompted calls for an end to the  locker room  culture in parliament. Just hours after Fallon resigned over past behavior he said had fallen  below the high standards we require of the armed forces , May appointed Gavin Williamson, 41, a rising star in her ruling Conservative Party. Weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in a June election that many Conservatives blame on her, May had to move swiftly.  The growing harassment scandal threatens to undermine her further if other allegations against Conservatives, including against her deputy Damian Green, force more resignations. Williamson has risen quickly up the ranks of the Conservatives and May selected him last year as the party s chief whip in parliament
