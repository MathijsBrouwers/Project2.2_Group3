Israel supports the establishment of a Kurdish state, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, as Kurds in Iraq gear up for a referendum on independence that lawmakers in Baghdad oppose. Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority ethnic group   whose indigenous population is split between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran   as a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. On Tuesday, Iraq s Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said he would press ahead with the Sept. 25 referendum despite a vote by Iraq s parliament rejecting it.

Western powers are concerned a plebiscite in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region
