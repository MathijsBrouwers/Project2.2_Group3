The leader of Germany s pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), a possible partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel s new government, has called for Russia to be invited to the next summit of the Group of Seven industrialized countries. The proposal met immediate resistance from Merkel s conservatives and the environmentalist Greens, throwing a possible wrench into already tricky negotiations about a three-way ruling coalition. FDP leader Christian Lindner told the Austrian newspaper Die Pressed that readmitting Russia to the Group of Eight could help ease tensions with Moscow. Russia was suspended from the group in 2014 after it annexed Ukraine s Crimea peninsula following an uprising in Kiev that toppled its pro-Moscow president.  We cannot make all things dependent on the situation in Crimea,  Lindner said, although he said Russia s violation of international law could not be accepted.  But this is the most severe conflict and that s the last place we ll see progress,  Lindner said.  That s why I m in favor of intensifying dialogue
