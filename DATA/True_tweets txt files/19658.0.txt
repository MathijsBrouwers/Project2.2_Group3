United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed on Tuesday for statesmanship to avoid war with North Korea and criticized world leaders who stoke resentment over refugees for political gain, two digs at U.S. President Donald Trump. In his first address to the annual 193-member U.N. General Assembly since taking office in January, Guterres said the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile program must be solved through a political process.   This is the time for statesmanship,  said the former prime minister of Portugal.  We must not sleepwalk our way into war.   Trump has warned North Korea that military action was an option for the United States as Pyongyang has carried out a series of tests toward developing the ability to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine  rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 and Guterres appealed for the 15-member body to maintain its unity on North Korea. Guterres, a former head of the U.N. refugee agency, also spoke of being  pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated
