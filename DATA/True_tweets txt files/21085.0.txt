The nations of the BRICS grouping strongly deplore North Korea s nuclear test but the problem over its nuclear program should only be settled through peaceful means and dialogue, they said in a draft communique seen by Reuters on Monday. In its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sunday, North Korea detonated what it said was an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile, prompting a vow of  massive  military response from the United States if it or its allies were threatened.  We express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,  the draft communique said.  A formal communique, known as the  Xiamen Declaration , is expected to be issued at a meeting attended by heads of state from the five major emerging economies in the grouping
