India s top court has agreed to hear a plea challenging a government decision to deport all of an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in the country after fleeing persecution in Myanmar, a lawyer involved in the case said on Friday. A petition was filed on behalf of two Rohingya men who live in Delhi after fleeing their village in Myanmar s Rakhine State, where the latest surge of violence has killed at least 400 people and sent about 40,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Hindu nationalist government said last month it was going to expel all Rohingya, even those registered with the U.N. refugee agency, drawing criticism from aid groups and some politicians.  The Supreme Court realizes the urgency of it, that s why they have agreed to hear it on Monday,  lawyer Prashant Bhushan told Reuters.   You can t send somebody away to face certain death in another country, that would be a violation of his Article 21 rights.  Bhushan said the Indian constitution s Article 21, on the protection of life and personal liberty, applied to non-citizens.  Deportation would also contradict the principle of non-refoulement
