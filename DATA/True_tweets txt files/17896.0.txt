A Vietnamese woman accused of killing the half-brother of North Korea s leader was captured on camera making an  aggressive  attack on him, two days after a similar act on another person, a police investigator told a Malaysian court on Tuesday. Doan Thi Huong, 28, is charged along with Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian woman, with killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13.     There was  a stark difference  in Huong s movements in two closed circuit television recordings made in the airport s third level departure hall, said police official Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz. The first recording on Feb. 11 showed Huong approach an unidentified member of the public from behind to wipe something on the person s face  in a soft manner , he said. She then appeared to apologize, placing her hands together and bowing her head, before retreating slowly, added Wan Azirul, a member of the airport district s Criminal Investigations Department.     But a similar act carried out on Kim Jong Nam was  quite rough and seemed more like an attack,  Wan Azirul said.       For me, the act seemed aggressive. Other differences I saw were in her movements
