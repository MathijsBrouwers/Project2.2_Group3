William Jackson remembers the exodus vividly, when over 10,000 Protestants fled the west bank of Londonderry s River Foyle for the city s suburbs as Northern Ireland s  Troubles  erupted.  Almost 50 years on Jackson is among some 250 Protestants who stayed and carved out a tiny enclave known as  The Fountain , a tight, fiercely pro-British community that is separated by high walls and fences from the surrounding Irish nationalist heartland.  You are not talking one or two families, you are talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds,  Jackson said, recalling the flight which began in 1969 when British troops were sent to the city to quell unrest over a civil rights campaign launched by the Catholic minority. Three decades of bloodshed followed between Catholic Irish nationalists, seeking to unite with Ireland, and pro-British Protestant loyalists, who want to remain part of the United Kingdom. Around 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace agreement. Much of Northern Ireland has since been transformed, yet in many areas the two sides remain separated by so-called  peace walls . The fences of up to 15 meters set up in the years after 1969 were supposed to be temporary but many still remain. In The Fountain, the metal gate in the wall between it and the nearby Bogside area
