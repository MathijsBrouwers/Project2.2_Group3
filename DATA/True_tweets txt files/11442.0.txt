Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Sunday he would propose to parliament transferring some of the country s troops stationed in Iraq to Niger to fight people smuggling and terrorism. Gentiloni said Italy s 1,400-strong military presence in Iraq could now be reduced after victories against Islamic militants and instead deployed in the Sahel region of West Africa.  We have to continue to work, concentrating our attention and energies on the threat of people trafficking and terrorism in the Sahel,  he said aboard the Italian ship Etna used in the European Union s  Sophia  operation to counter people smuggling in the Mediterranean.  For this reason, part of our forces in Iraq will be deployed to Niger in coming months
