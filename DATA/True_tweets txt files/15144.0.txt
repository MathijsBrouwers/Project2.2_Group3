The Whale ,  The Dog  or  The Zebra ? Players line up beside a small kiosk in a poor neighborhood to choose animals in a lottery game that has become a craze in Venezuela even as the oil-rich country suffers a fourth year of brutal recession. It seems more and more Venezuelans are turning to gambling in their desperation to make ends meet amid the country s unprecedented economic crisis. Though more people lose than win overall, the illusion of a payday has become more alluring as Venezuelans endure the world s highest inflation, shortages of basics from flour to car batteries, and diminished real-term wages. Among multiple options from race courses to back-street betting parlors, the roulette-style  Los Animalitos  (or the Little Animals) is currently by far the most popular game on the street.   Most people I see playing the lottery are unemployed, trying to make a bit extra this way because the payouts are good,  said Veruska Torres, 26, a nurse who recently lost her job in a pharmacy and now plays Animalitos every day.  Torres often plays more than a dozen times daily at the kiosk in Catia, spending between 5,000-10,000 bolivars, but sometimes making up to 50,000 or 60,000 bolivars in winnings
