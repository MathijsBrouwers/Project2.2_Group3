Power outages from Hurricane Irma dropped to about 6.1 million in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak over 7.4 million late Monday, according to local utilities. Most remaining outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, said its outages dipped below 2.8 million by Tuesday afternoon from a peak of over 3.6 million Monday morning. FPL said it expects to restore essentially all of its customers in the eastern portion of Florida by the weekend and the harder-hit western portion of the state by Sept. 22. The company, however, warned it would take longer to restore customers with tornado damage or severe flooding. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, fell to around 1 million by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak of about 1.2 million on Monday, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on Monday. In Georgia, utilities reported over 1.1 million customers without power Tuesday, down from a peak of around 1.3 million on Monday night. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama.
