European Council President Donald Tusk said on Sunday he was alarmed by the similarity of policies pursued by Poland s right-wing government to what he described as  Kremlin s plan . Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has been increasingly at loggerheads with the EU and Tusk since coming to office in late 2015, although the acrimony between Tusk and PiS dates back many years. The PiS is locked in disputes with the bloc over immigration, logging of an ancient forest and putting courts and media under more  government control. Tusk, Poland s former prime minister and the arch-rival of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, won a second term in March as chairman of EU summit meetings
