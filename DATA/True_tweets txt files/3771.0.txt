President Donald Trump’s alleged disclosure of highly classified information to Russia’s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating, officials said on Tuesday. Some experts added, however, that the reports could undermine trust between partners.  “If this really happened, it’s an unfortunate episode,”  said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now with the European Leadership Network think-tank in London. “But they’ll suck it up. Why? Because other countries need U.S. intelligence cooperation more than the other way round.”  In a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Trump disclosed intelligence about a planned Islamic State operation, which was supplied by a U.S. ally, two officials with knowledge of the situation said. The name of the ally or intelligence-sharing operation was not disclosed. [nL2N1IH1O9] The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect and Trump said he had an “absolute right” to share facts to get Moscow to step up its fight against Islamic State. Interfax news agency quoted the Russian foreign ministry saying the reports were “fake”. [nR4N1I601L] Two of Washington’s allies in the intelligence sharing network known as “Five Eyes”
