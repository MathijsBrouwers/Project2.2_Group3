Indonesia s speaker of parliament was on Friday named again as a suspect in a huge embezzlement case involving electronic identity cards that caused state losses of more than $170 million.  This is the second time the national Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has named Setya Novanto a suspect in the case, after he used a controversial legal maneuver to get earlier charges dropped last month.  He is suspected of illegally enriching himself...and causing state losses in the procurement of electronic ID cards,  KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said in a statement.  We have new evidence,  he said, declining to elaborate because authorities were still investigating. A lawyer for Novanto could not immediately be reached for comment. Novanto has previously denied wrongdoing. The KPK has been investigating allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million
