An estimated 370,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled to Bangladesh to escape violence in neighboring Myanmar since late August, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Vivian Tan, said on Tuesday. At least 457,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. They have joined many thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in Myanmar. Here are details gathered from U.N. sources working in the Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, on the Myanmar border, where many of the refugees end up.
