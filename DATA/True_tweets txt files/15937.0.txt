A suspected Islamist militant wounded two policemen with a knife near the parliament in Tunis on Wednesday and was later arrested, Tunisia s Interior Ministry said. It was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015. The assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be  tyrants , the statement said. One of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck, while the other was only lightly wounded, it said.   I saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman. He put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman,  a witness told Reuters.  He shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) as he attacked the policemen.  The Interior Ministry said Wednesday s suspect had confessed that  he had adopted Takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad .   Takfiri thought  refers to a view that Muslims should proclaim other Muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them. Large numbers of police were deployed to the Bardo square in the aftermath of the attack, a witness said. Blood could be seen on the ground in the square. The square is opposite the parliament building and close to the Bardo museum, where 21 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in an attack by three gunmen in March 2015. A security source told Reuters the attacker was 25 and from Ettadamen
