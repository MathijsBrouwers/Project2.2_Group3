German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Monday said the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan in recent years had been too rapid and she called for a longer-term commitment in the Hindu Kush mountain range. Visiting troops in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, von der Leyen criticized the rapid reduction in forces since the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ended its mission in Afghanistan in 2014 but said the international community had now learned it needed to be more patient.  I haven t forgotten how it was at the beginning when we got out of ISAF too quickly with too big a reduction in troop numbers,  she said, adding that everyone knew the security situation in Afghanistan remained tense. She said Afghans continued to need support, advice and training from foreign soldiers, adding:  There s still a lot to do but I m convinced that we re going in the right direction with our mission there.   We ll need to have a lot of stamina
