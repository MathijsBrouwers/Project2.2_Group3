U.S.-backed militias said they captured Syria s largest oil field on Sunday, pressing their assault against Islamic State in the east of the country. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they took al-Omar field on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river in the early hours.  Our forces managed to liberate the fields without notable damages,  said Lilwa al-Abdallah, spokeswoman for the offensive in Deir al-Zor province.  The jihadists holed up in buildings in a nearby district, where the SDF was trying to hunt them down, she said.  With U.S.-led jets and special forces, the SDF has been battling in Deir al-Zor bordering Iraq. The alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province.  The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, has been waging its own separate offensive against Islamic State, mostly to the west of the river.  The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have been holding deconfliction meetings
