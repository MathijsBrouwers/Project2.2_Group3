The new governor of Indonesia s capital faced a barrage of criticism on Tuesday for remarks in his inauguration speech that some residents and politicians warned could stoke ethnic and religious tension in the Southeast Asian country. Anies Baswedan, a former education minister, said in a speech only hours after he was sworn in on Monday that  pribumi  (native or indigenous Indonesians) should take back control of the country from  colonial  influences.  His comments came as tolerance in the Muslim-majority country has been under scrutiny since bitterly fought city elections this year during which Islamist-led rallies targeted the former governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian, in a controversial blasphemy case.   We  pribumi  people were oppressed and defeated. Now, after independence, it is time for us to be masters in our own country,  Baswedan said in a speech to supporters outside the Jakarta City Hall late on Monday.     The word  pribumi , which excludes ethnic groups like Chinese Indonesians or Indian Indonesians who have lived in the country for generations, was the top trending topic on Twitter in Indonesia on Tuesday.  You are of Arab descent yourself sir! So who do you mean when you say  it s time for pribumi to be masters of the country ?  user @denradityaa tweeted.  Baswedan is a descendant of the Hadrami tribe of Yemen and comes from a family of respected moderate Islamic scholars. Some took Baswedan s words to single out Chinese Indonesians
