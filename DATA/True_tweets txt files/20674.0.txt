Pope Francis on Thursday urged Colombians to shun vengeance after a bloody 50-year civil war but said leaders had to enact laws to end the  darkness  of injustice and social inequality that breeds violence. At the last event of a packed day, the Argentine pontiff said Mass for a crowd estimated by Colombian authorities at just over a million people in Bogota s sprawling Simon Bolivar Park. Under a light drizzle, he ended the day as he had begun it, urging Colombians in his homily to put their differences behind them and beware  the darkness of thirst for vengeance . Hours earlier, at the start of his first full day in the country, he had told government leaders in the courtyard of the presidential palace that all Colombians should see peace as a long-term commitment and not allow it to be weakened by partisan politics. Colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters of the FARC guerrilla group into society and aim to repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. Many Colombians are furious that under the 2016 peace deal, FARC leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail and may receive seats in congress as members of a political party. President Juan Manuel Santos, who attended both events and is the architect of the peace accord, has an approval rating of about 24 percent. In both speeches, Francis denounced the social inequality that still plagues Colombia, which has extreme poverty in some rural areas. At the morning event, he told leaders that  just laws  were needed to  resolve the structural causes of poverty that lead to exclusion and violence , calling social inequality  the root of social ills.  In the evening the leader of the world s Roman Catholics  told Colombians huddled on wet fields:  Here, as in other places, there is a thick darkness which threatens and destroys life
