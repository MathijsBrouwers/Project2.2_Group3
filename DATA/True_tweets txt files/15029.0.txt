U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had insulted him by calling him  old  and said he would never call Kim  short and fat.  Trump made the comment after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. In a series of tweets he also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was  upping sanctions  on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile programs and that Xi wanted Pyongyang to  denuclearize.  During Trump s visit to Beijing last week Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint it would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. One of Trump s tweets read:  Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me  old,  when I would NEVER call him  short and fat?  Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend
