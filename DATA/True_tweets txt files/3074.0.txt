U.S. House Democrats rejected an assertion by Deutsche Bank that privacy laws prevent it from sharing information about President Donald Trump’s finances, as they investigate possible collusion between his campaign team and Russia.    In a letter to the bank’s lawyers made public on Thursday, five Democrats who have been seeking financial information about Trump argued U.S. federal laws protecting banking customers’ confidentiality did not apply to requests from Congress. The bank could also circumvent privacy concerns by obtaining disclosure consent from the president and his family, they said. “Given President Trump’s repeated assertions that he does not have ties to Russia, such disclosure would ostensibly be in his interest,” they wrote. Deutsche Bank said on Thursday that its lawyers would respond “in due course.”  “We reiterate that while we seek to cooperate, we must obey the law,” the bank said in an emailed statement. Investigations are underway in Washington into claims of collusion between Trump’s inner circle and Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign
