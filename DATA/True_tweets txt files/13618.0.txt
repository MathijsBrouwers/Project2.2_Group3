A newly unveiled presidential contender for Mexico s ruling party attacked his main leftist rival on Tuesday, accusing him of being obsessed by power, afraid of debate and unable to tackle corruption when he held public office. Jose Antonio Meade, who resigned as finance minister on Monday to run for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), sought to discredit former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the early front-runner in the July 2018 election.  I m not afraid of Andres Manuel, I m sure I m going to beat him ... because there s a fundamental difference,  Meade told Mexican radio.  What he s about is hunger for power, and with me it s about wanting to serve and construct.  Graft scandals have battered the PRI s credibility under President Enrique Pena Nieto, and senior officials regard Meade as a strong candidate because he has avoided the taint of corruption in office
