The Californian Republican Party voted on Sunday to extend its term limit to allow the former lawmaker who brought the party back from near-bankruptcy in an increasingly Democratic state to seek a third term as chairman. Buoyed by a flush bank account and the prospect that members’ votes will matter in a presidential primary for the first time in decades, GOP members at their annual convention near San Francisco voted for a change to longtime party bylaws to allow former state Senator Jim Brulte to run again next year to be the party’s chairman. “I think he’s a great chairman and he’s done a lot for the party,” said Michael Escoto, 35, a delegate from Los Angeles. Brulte’s strong hand guiding normally fractious California Republicans was clear throughout the three-day convention, where newly energized members were courted by all three candidates vying for the national party’s presidential nomination
