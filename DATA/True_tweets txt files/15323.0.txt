Major issues  must still be resolved on safeguarding citizens  rights after Brexit, the European Parliament s negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said on Wednesday, the eve of another round of divorce negotiations between London and Brussels.  The talks have been grinding slowly and Verhofstadt said that London s assurances on the status of EU citizens living in Britain were not good enough.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has said the two sides were  in touching distance  of a deal and said on Tuesday the British government expected most EU citizens currently living in Britain would be allowed to stay after Brexit in 2019.  We don t recognize reports suggesting that a deal on citizens  rights is almost finalised. There are still major issues that have to be resolved,  Verhofstadt said. He said one of his concerns was that Britain should grant a settled status to EU citizens based on a free-of-charge declaration while London s latest proposal envisaged a conditional application. A spokesman for the British government said  the UK has made a fair and serious offer on citizens  rights  and  real progress  was made in the latest round of negotiations.  Safeguarding the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, and UK nationals in the EU, is our first priority in the negotiations,  the spokesman said.  We want to provide as much certainty as soon as possible to the many EU citizens who have made their lives in the UK and who make a huge contribution to our country.  London hopes the 27 other EU states would assess enough progress has been made in divorce talks
