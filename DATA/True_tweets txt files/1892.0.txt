The Trump administration drew vigorous responses to its announcement on Tuesday it would be ending an Obama-era program that allows children to stay in the United States who entered the country illegally.  Business executives, politicians and rights groups were outspoken in their reactions to the plan to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), whose beneficiaries were known as Dreamers. “Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate or lighten anyone’s taxes or raise anybody’s wages ... Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated.  It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be.”
