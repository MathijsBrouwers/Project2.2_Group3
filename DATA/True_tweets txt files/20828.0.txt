The Syrian army and its allies are fighting to secure a corridor to troops in Deir al-Zor, a day after they smashed through Islamic State lines to break the jihadist siege.  The army reached Deir al-Zor city on Tuesday in a days-long thrust that followed months of steady advances east across the desert, breaking a siege that had lasted three years.  Islamic State counter-attacks lasted through the day, trying to repel the army, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Fierce battles raged around the city, as troops sought to expand the route and allow aid in, the British-based war monitor added.   Work is progressing to secure the route and widen the flanks so as not to be cut or targeted by (Islamic State),  said a commander in the military alliance backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.   The next step is to liberate the city,  the non-Syrian commander said.     It points to a tough battle ahead as the army aims to move from breaching the siege to driving Islamic State militants from their half of the city, the sort of street-by-street warfare in which they excel.         Syrian state news agency SANA said the army had made gains expanding its control near the corridor after heavy artillery and air strikes.  Assad and his allies
