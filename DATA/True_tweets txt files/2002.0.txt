White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, who was closely aligned with a nationalist faction led by ousted senior strategist Steve Bannon, no longer works for President Donald Trump, the White House said on Friday. “Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,” a White House official said in a statement. The official did not elaborate, but the statement suggested that Gorka had been fired. Gorka had reportedly feuded with national security adviser General H.R. McMaster and was unhappy with the decision Trump announced this week
