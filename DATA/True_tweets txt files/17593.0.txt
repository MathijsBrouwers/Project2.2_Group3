Hong Kong s leader denied on Friday that China had taken over immigration controls in the city after a British activist was refused entry, but she couldn t rule out barring even the last colonial governor and frequent China critic, Chris Patten. Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended Hong Kong s autonomy amid deepening questions over the Chinese-ruled financial hub s reputation as a free and international city, after a Conservative Party rights activist, Benedict Rogers, was barred from entering on Wednesday. When asked on a radio talk show whether Patten, who has criticized perceived Chinese interference in Hong Kong affairs, would be the next to be barred, Lam stopped short of ruling it out.  I can t exclude any possibilities because immigration matters will change depending on the case,  she told public broadcaster RTHK. Patten, who spoke extensively during a recent Hong Kong visit and was critical of the jailing of several democracy activists, has angered some in the pro-Beijing establishment. Britain handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises that its widespread freedoms and autonomy would be respected under a  one country, two systems  formula. But China s Foreign Ministry said it had the right to allow or refuse any persons wanting to enter Hong Kong, in response to Rogers  case, as this was a matter of state sovereignty. The promise of autonomy is enshrined in the mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that creates a separate Hong Kong legal and policing regime, including immigration controls. But China has sovereign control over defense and foreign affairs
