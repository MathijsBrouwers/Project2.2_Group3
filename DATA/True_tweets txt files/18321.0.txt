Nigeria s financial crimes agency on Wednesday brushed off allegations by the wife of the country s former president that it had conducted a  witch-hunt  against her. Patience Jonathan, whose husband Goodluck Jonathan was the president of Africa s most populous country from 2010 to 2015, accused the head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of an  orchestrated plan  to tarnish her reputation and that of her husband. President Muhammadu Buhari took office in 2015 after defeating Goodluck Jonathan in elections during which he vowed to crack down on corruption. Buhari said state coffers were virtually empty when he assumed the presidency.  Last year, the EFCC froze four U.S. dollar bank accounts that the ex-president s wife said she owned. Her spokesman said in September 2016 that the accounts in total contained around $10 million
