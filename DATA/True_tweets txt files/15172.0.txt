U.S. President Donald Trump lauded his Beijing meetings on trade and North Korea as  very productive , ending a visit which Chinese media declared set a  new blueprint  for handling ties, even as the White House looks set for tougher action on China. Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea s nuclear ambitions and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but also praised Xi s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms.  Hours after Trump left Beijing on Friday, China said it would drop foreign ownership limits on local banks and asset management companies while loosening stake restrictions in securities firms and insurers
