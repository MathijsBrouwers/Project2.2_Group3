Drums and a band played as officials in black tops and ancient costumes rehearsed on Saturday for the funeral procession of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose cremation next week is expected to be attended by a quarter of a million mourners. Some held a mock-up of a golden urn that had held the remains of dead kings in the past. In the present, the king s body is placed in a coffin but the urn is still used to represent the monarch s remains. The procession rehearsal, which was expected to take up to five hours, passed crowds of black-clad mourners in Bangkok s historic quarter.  Some were visibly moved by the proceedings. Others held gold-framed portraits of the late king. The military government has set 3 billion baht ($90 million) aside for the lavish funeral.
