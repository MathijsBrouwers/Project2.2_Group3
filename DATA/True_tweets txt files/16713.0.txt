A new girls  school for Syrian refugees in Lebanon s poor Bekaa region is aiming to give girls from conservative backgrounds  the chance at a formal education.  Gaining access to education in general is difficult for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, but for girls from socially conservative families who disapprove of mixed schools, it is even harder.       Zahra al-Ayed, 14, and her sister Batoul, 17, were from a village in Syria s northern Idlib province where women were expected to marry young.  But the experience of fleeing war and living in harsh poverty woke her parents to the life-changing importance of education, the girls  mother Mirdiyeh al-Ayed said.   My eldest daughter tells me that she will not marry until after she finishes her education. She even wants to travel abroad and learn,  she said.      Human Rights Watch organisation said in its latest report in April that more than half a million refugee children are out of school in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In Lebanon, international donors paid for 200,000 public school spaces for Syrian children in 2015-2016, according to the HRW report, but only 149,000 children actually enrolled. Lebanese and international non-governmental organizations have been striving to fill the gap, and to eliminate the legal, financial and language barriers preventing refugee children from getting their education.     For the al-Ayed family, used to Syria s system of gender segregation after the age of 12, one big barrier to enrolling the girls was the lack of single-sex schools in Lebanon that accept refugees.  The new school that Zahra will attend is in Bar Elias in the Bekaa valley and was opened on Thursday by the Kayany Foundation, a Lebanese charity. It educates 160 Syrian girls aged from 14-18 who have missed school for several years.  Those who manage to pass the Lebanese system s eighth grade exams
