A lawyer for Indonesia s parliament speaker denied on Thursday that the politician had gone into hiding to avoid being questioned by an anti-corruption agency over a $170 million graft investigation and said his client had a busy schedule. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) sought to arrest speaker Setya Novanto at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday, but failed to find him, sparking speculation about his whereabouts.  He is not hiding,  Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, told Reuters by telephone.   He is very busy, invited to many events and such. If he hears of violations of any law, he will discuss it with other officials,  said Yunadi. Novanto, who is chairman of Indonesia s second-biggest political party, Golkar, was still in Jakarta, he added. Novanto was not available for comment. He has previously denied wrongdoing but has missed repeated KPK summons for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million
