Australia and East Timor have reached a breakthrough agreement on a maritime border, ending a decade-old row between the two nations that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project.   The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague announced on Saturday that the neighboring countries had reached an agreement  on the central elements of a maritime boundary delimitation between them in the Timor Sea    but that details would remain confidential until the deal was finalised. Arbitration began last year and the talks, hosted by Denmark, resulted in a deal on Aug. 30. The countries agreed to establish a special regime for the Greater Sunrise field, paving the way for its development and the sharing of the resulting revenue, the court said in a statement.  Until all issues are resolved, the details of the Parties  agreement will remain confidential,  the statement said.  Nevertheless, the Parties agree that the agreement reached on 30 August 2017 marks a significant milestone in relations between them and in the historic friendship between the peoples of Timor-Leste and Australia.  The leader of East Timor s delegation, chief negotiator and former President Xanana Gusm o, hailed the agreement as a historic moment which would mark the beginning of  a new era in Timor-Leste s friendship with Australia .      I thank the Commission for its resolve and skill in bringing the Parties together, through a long and at times difficult process, to help us achieve our dream of full sovereignty and to finally settle our maritime boundaries with Australia,  Gusm o said. Timor, a former Portuguese colony, has struggled to develop as an independent nation since a violent break from occupying forces from Indonesia in 1999. Gas reserves, once claimed by Australia, is a key to its economic future.  The long-running political dispute has led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields
