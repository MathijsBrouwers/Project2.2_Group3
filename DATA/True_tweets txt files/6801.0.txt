Country star Garth Brooks is in discussions to perform at the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the singer’s representative said on Friday, as organizers of the event denied media reports that they were struggling to find A-list stars to take part. Brooks, 54, one of the world’s best-selling solo artists, performed for Democrat Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, along with a line-up that included Bruce Springsteen, U2, Beyonce, and Stevie Wonder. “Garth has performed for the five living presidents,” his publicist Nancy Seltzer said on Friday. “While rumor has it that he has been asked to perform for President-elect Trump, he has not been able to commit yet.” No celebrities have yet been announced as taking part in the Jan. 20 inauguration. Brooks, a Country Hall of Famer with U.S. sales of more than 135 million albums, is currently in Hawaii as part of a world tour. He is due to perform in Cincinnati, Ohio on Jan. 21
