Republicans kept control of both chambers of the U.S. Congress in Tuesday’s election, empowering the party to reshape Washington along with Donald Trump, who won the White House. The following outlines what was at stake in the races, and results based on television projections and state election boards:	 U.S. Senate, 100 seats With a handful of races still to be decided, Republicans had secured 51 seats in the 100-member Senate, dashing Democrats’ hopes to take control of the chamber. Senators serve six-year terms. A third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. Procedural rules in the Senate mean 60 votes are needed to advance major initiatives. Republicans entered the election with 54 seats, led by Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, versus the Democrats’ 44 seats and two independents. The Democrats’ leader in the next Senate is expected to be New York’s Chuck Schumer. The Republicans this year were defending 24 seats. The Democrats defended 10 seats and gained only one, in Illinois. U.S. House, 435 seats Television networks declared that Republicans, as expected, retained their majority in the House of Representatives and lost fewer seats than anticipated. Members of the House serve two-year terms and all are up for re-election every two years. To advance most bills in the House, 218 votes or more are needed. Republicans went into the elections holding 246 seats to the Democrats’ 186. There were three vacancies. The Republican leader is Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin; the Democrats’ leader is Nancy Pelosi of California. To win a majority, Democrats had needed to gain 30 seats. In a blow to Democrats, Republicans were on pace to lose only nine seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some analysts had predicted.
