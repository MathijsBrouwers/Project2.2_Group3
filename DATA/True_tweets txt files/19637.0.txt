Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi urged Palestinians to overcome their differences and be ready to co-exist with each other and with Israelis in safety and security.   I tell the Palestinian people it s extremely important ... to overcome the differences and not to lose opportunities and to be ready to accept co-existence with the other, with Israelis in safety and security,  Sisi told the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York. Following Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  Western-backed Fatah faction, Islamist Hamas said on Sunday it would dissolve its  administrative committee  to enable Abbas  administration to retake control in the Gaza Strip. Hamas urged Abbas on Tuesday to respond by ending his sanctions on the impoverished enclave. Addressing the Israelis, Sisi said:  We have an excellent experience in Egypt in peace with you for longer than 40 years.   We can repeat this experience and this excellent step once again
