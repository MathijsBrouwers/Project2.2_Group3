A Japanese cosmetics firm has apologized for a sign banning entry for Chinese people posted in one of its outlets, highlighting lingering hostility to foreign visitors from some in Japan as it strives to extend a shopping-driven tourism boom. Pola, a unit of Pola Orbis Holdings Inc, said on Saturday that images of an  inappropriate  poster were shared on Chinese social media sites on Friday, without specifying the   contents or location of the offending item.  Photos of a sign handwritten in Japanese saying  Entry by Chinese people prohibited  in a shop window were trending on Chinese and Taiwanese social media on Sunday. Pola, which has around 4,600 stores across Japan, apologized for causing  unpleasant feelings and inconvenience to many people  and said it had removed the sign.  As soon as we confirm the facts, we will suspend operations at the store and implement strict punishment,  it said in a statement posted at the top of its homepage in both Japanese and Chinese. Pola s mea culpa comes as Japan looks to boost a Chinese-powered inbound tourism boom ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
