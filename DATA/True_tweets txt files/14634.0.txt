Diplomacy backed by military power is needed to deal with North Korea s missile and nuclear development, the head of the U.S. military s Pacific Command said on Thursday. North Korea has launched dozens of missile tests under the leadership of Kim Jong Un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. In recent months, it has fired two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test, stoking regional tension.  Clearly, while diplomacy must be the main effort with North Korea, it has to be diplomacy backed by credible military power,  Admiral Harry Harris said in Japan at the beginning of a meeting with Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera. U.S. President Donald Trump visited China this month seeking its help to rein in North Korea and a senior Chinese diplomat will visit the North from Friday.
