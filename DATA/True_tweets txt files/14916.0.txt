North Korea complained to the United Nations on Monday about joint military exercises by the United State and South Korea, describing it as  the worst ever situation  because U.S. nuclear war equipment had been deployed ready to strike. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, North Korean U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the United States was  running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula.  Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups have been involved in the joint exercise in the Western Pacific in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia. The last time three U.S. carrier strike groups exercised together in the Western Pacific was in 2007. South Korea has said the joint drill, due to finish on Tuesday, was in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations and to show any such developments by Pyongyang can be repelled with  overwhelming force.  However, Ja said Washington was to blame for escalating tensions and accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring  the nuclear war exercises of the United States who is hell bent on bringing catastrophic disaster to humanity.  Ja asked Guterres to bring to the attention of the 15-member council
