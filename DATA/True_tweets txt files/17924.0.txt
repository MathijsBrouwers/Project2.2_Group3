U.S. academic Richard Thaler, who helped popularize the idea of  nudging  people towards doing what was best for them, won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize on Monday for his work on how human nature affects supposedly rational markets.  Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.   I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,  Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in a call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.  Asked at a separate news conference in Chicago if it was difficult to get traditional, data-oriented economists to embrace his ideas, Thaler said it was "impossible...economists don't do a lot of embracing actually."  Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said:  Richard Thaler s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.    His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.   Thaler brought to prominence the idea of  nudge  economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.
