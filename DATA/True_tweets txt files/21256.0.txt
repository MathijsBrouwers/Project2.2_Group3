Archaeologists in Spain have unearthed more bodies from mass graves dating back to the 1936-1939 civil war and the ensuing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, including some still wearing rotting leather boots.  The digs in a local cemetery in Valladolid, central Spain, come amid renewed efforts by volunteer associations and victim campaign groups to shed a light on the bloody past and bring closure for relatives still searching for family members.  Four mass graves have now been excavated in Valladolid and 228 bodies recovered there since April 2016.  These graves are believed to be among more than 2,000 mass burial sites thought to exist across Spain from the civil war
