U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, while chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), used an alias for emails with employees and board members because his primary account was jammed with too many messages, the oil company said on Tuesday. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson’s climate-change communications through it. Exxon denied trying to hide anything.  “This was not an alias used to discuss only climate change,” Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Tuesday. “It was an account used for everyday business by senior executives who needed to reach” Tillerson, who left the company at the end of 2016 to become secretary of state. Tillerson received thousands of emails a day from climate change activists and others at his regular address
