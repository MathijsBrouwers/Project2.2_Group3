Nepalis began voting in the final round of parliamentary elections on Thursday, a key step to complete a near decade-long democratic transition after the abolition of the centuries-old monarchy and the end of a civil war against Maoist guerrillas. The first phase of the election was held on Nov. 26, with final results not expected for about another 10 days because of the cumbersome vote-counting procedure, officials said. Officials said more than 200,000 soldiers and police had been deployed to maintain security at polling centers after one person was killed and dozens wounded in a series of small blasts in the run-up to the polls.  Hundreds of activists, including from a splinter group of Maoists opposed to the election, have been detained for creating trouble,  army spokesman Nain Raj Dahal said. More than 15 million people were eligible to vote for the  275-member parliament
