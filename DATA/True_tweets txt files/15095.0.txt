Indonesia s military said on Friday it was prepared to take tough measures against rebels who have threatened to  destroy  the mining operations of Freeport-McMoRan Inc in the eastern province of Papua in their independence struggle. Police say an armed separatist group linked to the Free Papua Movement (OPM) is preventing about 1,000 people in five villages from leaving an area near the giant Grasberg copper mine, operated by a unit of the Arizona-based company. A state of emergency has been declared and at least 300 additional security forces have been deployed to the area after a string of shootings since Aug. 17 killed one police officer and wounded six. The group, the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), on Friday denied occupying villages near the mine. Hendrik Wanmang, a representative of TPN-OPM, said none of its more than 2,000 fighters was stationed in the villages.  We cannot mingle with the community,  Wanmang said in a telephone interview.  That would endanger them.  Wanmang also denied police allegations his group had carried out rape and torture of civilians, saying villagers were  continuing to carry out activities as usual . But he warned that Freeport employees and security personnel remained in the area at their own risk.   We are at war against the National Police, Indonesian military and Freeport,  he said.  (TPN-OPM) will continue to fight until the root of this problem
