Jewish groups in Europe and the United States expressed alarm at the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Sunday s parliamentary election and urged other parties not to form alliances with it. But a leading member of the AfD, which won 12.6 percent of the vote in the federal election to become the third largest party in Germany s lower house of parliament, said Jews had nothing to fear from his party s success. The far-right has not been represented in parliament since the 1950s, a reflection of Germany s efforts to distance itself from the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust. Ronald Lauder, president of the New York-based World Jewish Congress, called Chancellor Angela Merkel a  true friend of Israel and the Jewish people  and decried the AfD s gains at a time when anti-Semitism was increasing across the globe.  It is abhorrent that the AfD party, a disgraceful reactionary movement which recalls the worst of Germany s past and should be outlawed, now has the ability within the German parliament to promote its vile platform,  Lauder said. Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked also expressed concern about the AfD s success:  I hope that the German people learn carefully the history of Germany and remember the Holocaust and all the ...reasons that led to this tragedy.  The AfD, which has surged in the two years since Merkel opened Germany s borders to more than 1 million migrants mainly fleeing Middle East wars, says immigration jeopardizes Germany s culture but denies it is racist or anti-Semitic.  There s nothing in our party or in our program that could or should in any way concern Jewish people who live here in Germany,  Alexander Gauland, the AfD s top candidate, told reporters on Monday.  Gauland also cited Germany s strong diplomatic support for Israel, suggesting that it should also be ready to send troops if necessary to help defend the country as it faces off against the Palestinians and hostile neighboring states. Volker Beck, a member of the Greens, said Gauland s comments suggested that he was questioning Germany s support for Israel
