Farmers who fled war in the Colombian Andes are returning to revive their abandoned land, cultivating coffee trees that are boosting global supplies of the highest-quality beans. Colombia s five-decade civil war, the longest in the Americas, displaced millions and disrupted farming for decades in areas that produce coffee for the most exacting consumer. The revival of coffee farming in the former conflict zones could help boost Colombia s coffee output by 40 percent, according to government estimates. That would raise global supplies of mild arabica beans by about 13 percent. The additional supply could reduce the cost of the raw material for the world s top roasters, many of whom are seeking to secure increased supply from Colombia. About 950 coffee-growing families have returned to the San Carlos area, representing about 60 percent of the 1,600 families who left during the war, according to data from the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC). The supply from this region, about 330 kilometers (205 miles) north west of the Colombian capital of Bogota, could expand further as farmers plant more of their land and more people return to the region to provide the needed labor. The area now has about 800 hectares of coffee farms, double the low of 400 hectares during the war. That s still only about half of the 1,500 hectares prior to the conflict, according to FNC data. Among those who returned was Libardo Garcia, who lost two brothers in the conflict
