Turkey said on Friday the European Union was making a  child s game  out of its membership talks, wrangling over threats to end them, and reminded the bloc of its strategic importance abutting Middle Eastern conflict zones. After trading bitter barbs for months with President Tayyip Erdogan, largely over Turkey s human rights record, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday it was clear Turkey should not join the EU and accession talks should end. Most other EU states reacted cautiously to her comments and said any real discussion would be possible only after German elections on Sept. 24. But some, like Austria, backed Merkel and some officials have suggested suspension of talks.  This is not a children s game at all,  Turkish EU Minister Omer Celik said after meeting EU foreign ministers in Estonia s capital Tallinn.   You cannot talk about suspending or halting the accession negotiations and then restarting it in six months, and that Turkey is a great strategic and important country.  The bloc has been shocked by the scale of Erdogan s purges and the intensity of his crackdown on dissenters
