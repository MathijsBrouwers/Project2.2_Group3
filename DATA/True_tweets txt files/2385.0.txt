U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that relations with Russia would not improve until Moscow changed its stance on Ukraine and withdrew support for “regimes like Iran and Syria and North Korea”. The U.S. Congress voted last week for new sanctions on Russia and, at a news conference in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, Pence said the “lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place”. “Russia’s destabilizing activities in Ukraine, their support for rogue regimes like Iran and Syria and North Korea ... their posture has to change,” he said at a joint news conference with Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili. Pence said U.S. President Donald Trump would sign the new sanctions on Russia into law this week and said that Trump and Congress were “speaking with a unified voice”. Keeping to previous U.S. administrations’ line, Pence also condemned Russia’s presence in Georgia. Moscow, whose annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted U.S. and EU sanctions, still has troops stationed in Georgia after a 2008 war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia, backing Georgia’s Abkhazia, a region also controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Pence also said the U.S. was still behind Georgia’s application to become a member of NATO. “We’ll continue to work closely with this prime minister and the government of Georgia broadly to advance the policies that will facilitate becoming a NATO member,” he said.     NATO promised Georgia membership in 2008, and three ex-Soviet Baltic nations
